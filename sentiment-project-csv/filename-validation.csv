1.0,the food was good and delicious the only reason it wasnt a 5 star review is the price is a bit on the higher side but to go on a morning date or something wouldnt be crazy to feed a family breakfast its a bit high i would definitely eat here again and i will be next time ill eat there not to go would highly recommend it if waffles are your thing the mojo jojo is good the elvis is on point with the peanut butter and bacon yummmm,2020-03-01 17:30:02,_RcViMdWJtCHKem_EnRr4w
1.0,stopped by the roost twice this weekend to get some french fries for my son im surprised that there arent many places in north market that sell french fries this place seasons their fries well and theyre tasty so my son had them twice on two different days if youre looking for some fries these are good at 4 per order and there is a good portion,2020-03-02 12:51:31,nOr3_aq60yivqgcso_iDMw

-1.0,"being in boston for so long ive actually never tried this hot pot place in chinatown ive always gone to either q happy lamb and most recently liuyishou and i think there is a reason why i have not gone and i probably wont go back any time soon

to sum it up the experience is just average nothing really memorable the meat served to us was frozen and have bloody spot on it clearly it hasnt been prepared properly the decor and color of the restaurant seems old we were sat near the entrance and we can feel the wind chill still and price is like around 35 a person after all which isnt cheaper than other places either 

if you want to try it just to see what it is feel free to do so but i wouldnt recommend for going more often than that there is a lot of room for them to improve to compete with other hot pot places in chinatown",2020-02-19 23:16:29,NJVB1nGV1Fg-9xxAZ3gcWA
1.0,"i got a reservation for 2 here the night before i saw a concert the dining experience itself was very good the food came out great and i thoroughly enjoyed my burger but i couldnt finish it i liked the atmosphere although the lighting was kind of a little too dark for my taste im also glad i took a lyft there because theres not really any parking 

when i find a restaurant i like i usually pick up some merchandise from them but they did not have my size unfortunately i cant say that i can ding them on that but the place was very loud which made communicating with my waiter pretty difficult",2020-02-02 00:55:49,-URW2RBQc-d7hridC69nXw

-1.0,"this place have completely backward leadership and management role let take an example of the service manager is platon

i talked to him today 01172020 at 135pm
i told him a storytelling
i was there last friday around 1230pm to have them checked my windshield fluid and oil i had waited till 230pm and the car wasnt done yet one of the advisors came and talked to me your car is almost done do you need to  washed  i said yes he continued also we found a nail on your front  driver side do you need it fixed  i said yes of course i need to pick  up my son in  salem at 6pm he said it will be 20 to get it fixed i said why i have been a customer here for a long time and i bought tires here he said  i know it would not be a fee but its our policy i said to himits ok dont fix it please and pump up some air i will go to discount tires near by 

i got to that discount tire near sunnyside and 82nd ave there were no parking lots available because people are rushing to get ready for the snow storm hits the next week so i parked in front the front door i checked in and the advisor there told me  we didnt see this car has been serviced here he saw other two cars but not this one i told them i have it serviced at the dealer he said no worry ill check you in then he said  its be free of charge but you are looking about 3hrs to 4hrs wait he said lots of people are also waiting in front you we are busy today he said  i am sorry 
i told him  i have no choice please go ahead i have to pick up my son in salem at 6pm he confirmed with  me  are you going to pick up your son at 6pm today   i said yes he looked at me and said   i see what i can do please have a seat 
after 45mn waited he came out to me  your car is ready sir have a safe drive to salem and pick up your son 

you guys see it 
that business is even small they could have done like this dealer does to me its just business but they dont they stand by their value and their value is  trust and cooperation if this discount tires keep this leadership behavior going they will always thrive to last 

now turn around to my conversation with platon the service manager at honda  dealer he interrupted me most of the time to get his defensive out from his leadership style he said like we pay our tech to work so we have to charge fees to our clientsor you mean  i dont care about you as human beings or your issue whatever yoohoo seem to have i am here to make profit the more they make the more bonus i will get another part was he said  wowi would have paid  20 to get it fixed beside waiting there for 34hrs when he interrupted me in the middle of i was telling simply amazing right 

if this place faces issues its not the employees and techs fault simply the mistake of hiring the leadership with high performance but low trust people will not follow them around they will do what the leaders said because they have authority over them but they dont follow they have no passion and desire to achieve the vision and goals of this leadership good luck",2020-01-17 22:07:49,ahRuKgc3F5hDJx_qtD0A4w

1.0,"we stopped at rally pizza because veganizer sent me a menu for january that theyd be offering for the month everything looked pretty good so since we are in vancouver on sundays we decided to try it for lunch i was not sorry we did our bank balance may be though since this may have to become a regular thing 

we started with the warm flatbread and it is lovely crispy and thin crust with a light and fluffy center spices are just right not too heavy and not too light 

we then shared the warm lentil veg  greens bowl and it is delicious the lentils were perfectly cooked and not soggy or mushy the squash and seasonal vegetables are diced small and a lovely added flavor the herbed tahini and date molasses dressing are incredible the flavor is subtle enough not to overpower the flavor of the dish but adds a lovely bit of spice and flavor 

we also ordered the sweet potato fritters to share and they are fantastic crispy and warm and soft on the inside a perfect fritter to be honest the cornmeal crust is just delightful the cashew coconut curry dipping sauce is lovely again perfectly balanced in flavor creamy soft with just a touch of curry and coconut flavor to not distract from the fritters 

we then split the winter wonderland pizza and wow i wasnt expecting to love this pizza how i do the mushrooms are subtle but meaty the aleppo peppers provide a nice spice but not spicy for those who are worried about spicy the pickled red onions are great not too vinegar tasting the roasted cauliflower is cut very small so youre not nailed with a powerful cauliflower taste the spiced hazelnuts are to die for so incredibly good and the lemon zest wow i absolutely loved that on the pizza 

our kids shared the kids vegan pizza and loved the cashew cream cheese 

and we shared a scoop of the vegan coconut sorbet now i am not a sorbet person but it was nice a bit to sweet for me but the kids and my husband absolutely devoured it because they loved it 

rally has a great beverage menu with loads of cocktails beers and wines to choose from for the vegans january offers us this special menu and its really amazing however they always have the cashew cream for a cheese topping so you can come anytime and build your own i think as a vegan foodie what really got me in my taste bud feels was how cohesive every dish was in flavor nothing overwhelmed my taste buds but wow what a great balance of salt fat acid and heat delicious 

our server was great and the entire experience was aces i couldnt recommend it more we will absolutely be back",2020-01-05 21:54:11,oadVy9LmH_PYXOtK1BN3KA

1.0,"this review doesnt include the inside of the restaurant due to the covid19 mandate 
it was an early friday evening and service at the drive up was very busy let me start with from my viewpoint kellys isnt about value i feel the sandwiches are on the pricey end 
i ordered a  meal at the drive up sandwich a combo of fries  onion rings along with a diet coke from a friendly voice i could clearly understand without any static not to go off track but there are times when at a drive up you either get so much static that you end up repeating the order several times or the person on the other end has a difficult time understanding the order weve all be there right 
 there were several cars ahead but the wait wasnt too bad when it became my turn my order was packaged exactly as i asked for  i was starving  paid and parked in the lot to ingest my meal opening it the sandwich looked great however the fries and onion rings not so muchthe rings waaaay over fried 
ok small price to pay the sandwich of which they are famous for was excellent 
so what can i say its a tough time restaurants are dealing with being short staffed and unable to operate as well as theyd like to be i will try it again giving it another chance once the restrictions are lifted",2020-05-10 21:46:47,cN9C0TKcsLqNLZJ1QmmXNw

emily handed us a catalog where we were able to point out what dresses my maid of honor wanted to try on and we were able to ask about different color schemes

-1.0,"id add 12 a star if i could but i cant so three it is this place is super close to my apartment and i drive by all the time but after a year i finally decided to try the food we ordered in using postmates

things we tried turkey burger fries onion rings sweet potato tots vietnamese chicken wings and a strawberry shortcake milkshake

the turkey burger was good but there was nothing standout about it that would make me want to order it again the fries were equally okay good but nothing about them that you couldnt find elsewhere s

our favorites from the order were the onion rings and the sweet potato tots the onion rings were light and crispy and had a nice flavor i was loooking really foward to the marshmallow foam it said it would come with but sadly it wasnt included in the order  luckily they were sweet enough that i didnt miss it too much 

i love ice cream in any form so i had to get a milkshake they have interesting favors like red velvet captain crunch and krispy kreme donut and it was really hard for me to choose i ended up going with strawberry shortcake i enjoyed it a lot it has strawberry pieces shortcake bites and  whipped cream my only gripe is that but the size was extremely underwhelming for 6 it came in a plastic togo cup that was about halfway full i selected a small and they said ok bet i imagine if itd gotten the large maybe it would have been a full cup anyway you can get an equally tasty shake thats 23x the size and 12 the price at sonic 

the chicken wings were interesting nice and saucy not cooked too hard they had this mango salsachutney type stuff on top my gf really liked them and even ate them cold later on but im an atlanta girl and i probably wouldve been happier with the buffalolemon pepper 

id definitely order from here again i really want to try some of the boozy milkshakes",2020-06-04 03:20:33,kAvwnOFhus7nQ1MCCS-_uQ

food 
the pate is phenomenal all of the breads are house made  and it shows the highlight of my meals thus far was the brandt beef two ways a mixture of beef cheek hanger steak and celery root  the pairing and textures of these ingredients make for a very memorable dish every dessert that we have tried has been a winner

1.0,"pizza done right  we ordered a full pepperoni pie to take home and share between 3 adults and 2 kids  this is a classic thin crispy crust pizza  its not overly saucy  theres pepperoni in every bite  my kids who arent normally pizza fans loved this and said it was their favorite pizza ever  the crust retained its crispness despite the drive home

we also had a slice of the meatball onion pizza and it was delicious as well  the meatballs were flavorful  the slices are big

-1.0,the lunch buffet was delicious so i would give 4stars for the food alone it is not the typical indian buffet dishes and we were excited to try so many new things we thought we found a hidden gem and were psyched to come back and tell our friends however everything went downhill with service after waiting around for a check we put on our coats and stood around for a few minutes making eye contact with the servers but no one came so i tried walking up to the cash register as soon as i approached a woman rushed over out of nowhere and asked if i was paying and i said yes then another customer rushed over after me and  just handed her his credit card even though she acknowledged me first she went ahead and processed his payment blatantly allowing him to cut me then she charged us the kids rate for our baby 995 for what my 1year old baby ate what a terrible experience  her rudeness ruined our whole meal,2020-02-10 15:19:50,VFurB1KwvfYIPcLugfUQJw
-1.0,this was one of my first times staying in a four points and i was not very impressed at all ill start with the good location is perfect and very close to the many attractions of orlando there are also a good amount of close food options nearby so you dont have to go far to look for food the main area of opportunity for this hotel are the rooms it is definitely time for an upgrade the rooms are very much dated and even have that old room odor it was clean as it could be but its just definitely time for a remodel the rooms do offer a nice view of the surrounding area the staff and service was also very good even though i only stayed for a night  it met my basic need of providing a  clean place to lay my head the parking also was not the greatest this hotel shares a lot with a neighboring business so it was a little rough finding good parking,2020-01-01 21:40:46,6L6_Mjw7Ilu9CW_43_5_XA

1.0,had a great time in the observation wheel with my daughter and husband we went early sunday afternoon and got our own capsule since there were not that many people at that time of the day it was sunny and beautiful outside  the service in the wheel was great i would say id recommend this attraction one thing though we bought a deal online for the wheel plus a restaurant in the park complex the deal was pretty good however what we didnt like about the deal itself is that when we got to the restaurant they didnt have much idea of the bundle deal so the person in the counter had to ask their manager what was it about eventually it was fixed we ate but it was awkward that the restaurant didnt inform their employee about its promotions not biggie really the experience in the wheel itself was awesome,2020-02-16 03:44:57,4OrpukSBIM2VmbM00x2LAw

first off the number of options here are crazy ive been ordering from here for the past few years and havent  worked my way through half the menu yet what i can tell you

the momo is 6 bucks for 8 dumplings

i have no reason to lie on here and quite frankly the fact that i paid for my free fix is part of the reason i gave a review in the first place 

honestly its pathetic that you are accusing a customer of lying about a payment and tip its embarrassing that i even agreed to pay for a fix i hate to even admit that i had to pay again for a terrible service where the technicians scoffed at me

1.0,"we came to granville island this afternoon to do our big shop and support local businesses when we came and rediscovered the grainry wed last visited about a year before in search of authentic portuguese piripiri which they have fyi and decided it was time to restock the spice collection at home with all of this home cooking while the shop is closed to customers as a precaution against covid19 the staff were extremely attentive friendly and helpful in helping find products or giving recommendations as i wasnt sure what we needed to restock 

im pretty sure it was the owner helping me out as he seemed to do the buying for the shop  it was awesome as hes clearly a foodie and passionate about using the best quality ingredients he gave me about 5 different suggestions for different spices to use on steaks beef and chicken all based on some of his favourite combinations we tend to go for more latin and iberian cuisines so it was cool getting new ideas on how to incorporate middle eastern and north african flavours we only ended up buying a couple of staples this time onion powder garlic powder green oregano chiles de árbol and liquid smoke but were planning on looking in our cupboards and going back to restock in a couple of days with a comprehensive list

were happy to support small local businesses and were happy to add the grainry to our repertoire super friendly knowledgable staff great selection of products with new stuff coming in all the time and the prices are totally reasonable definitely check it out

my only constructive feedback would be that since customers cant go into the shop at the moment to have a full list of products both on their website and available to look at onsite most folks may already know what they want when they come though i think there are a few of us who get inspired by what we find",2020-04-20 02:50:27,85YDPD8_vXeofnUQkSkZ3w

last time we came here which was a few weeks ago we were meeting friends that flew in from phoenix  visiting the museum was one of the highlights of their trip  
what a fantastic collection housed in a beautiful italianate palace which marries well with the newer exhibition and concert venue each room had detailed printouts about the works exhibited and most rooms had an expert who could give further background information the lady who talked about the isabella stewart gardner portrait by singer sargent was very engaging and knowledgeable and as a result of listening to her i retraced my steps to see some items that i had missed on my first circuit we also used the reading room which is a super place to sit and either research artists and exhibits or to just sit and listen to the little canary singing

the person who served us is really friendly and joked with us a lot which made the experience awesome at quarantine time the choices at the place is simpler no fancy flavors like blue star or voodoo but they are so good we had original old fashion apple fritter and strawberry and raspberry cream 

their original donut is so good just like the ones we  are as kids at amusement park or state fairs the apple fritter and old fashion are amazing too one thing i didnt like so much are the jam filled one as a sweet tooth they are relative sour to me and also the donut itself for those ones are a bit dry

-1.0,"a special occasion is coming up for a family member i havent seen in a decade so because i dont live in oregon ive been super anxious trying to figure out whats good reliable and what my fellow hermit of a cousin might like to cheer him up for his bday i found this place on doordash and it struck the recesses of my memory from 20 years ago  i couldnt remember who between he and my other cousin liked brownies or cookies but they had both and it was a better idea than other desserts in the area so this was an exciting find i managed to get my cousins address through great pains and eventually figured out a plan

even though doordash offers instructions i knew full well anything could go wrong especially since ive never stepped foot out there myself so i didnt want to throw the owners or employees off guard with a sudden set of instructions on a regular order i really hate calls so it took me a few days to prepare myself mentally i waited til 2 days before and called to ask them if a basic note of any kind on the box would be possible so hed at least know who it was from however the lady who answered just now was extremely rude and passive aggressive kept cutting me off with snide irrelevant comments completely ignoring what i was asking which was all for her damn sake it happened so fast i didnt catch on until she corrected me that they had 6 options  i said there were only a few on doordash  which i just checked they do only have a few  but what did any of this matter for a simple question i had already asked a few times as if i should know anything about your company  this is the whole reason im going through the trouble of calling and asking the least you could do is communicate without being hostile why would you answer the phone if you have crappy customer service skills i literally prefaced my call with im not in oregon and want to surprise someone and you think immediatelycontinuously cutting me off with a holier than thou attitude is the answer geeez

finally after several attempts for me to speak she must have realized she was about to lose a customer because she only then asked what my question was i had already said it several times at this point and was just so shocked at her unnecessary and completely unprofessional hostility that i didnt know what to say so out of default kindness i really shouldve just hung up on her childish tantrum behavior i repeated myself and quickly got off the phone completely disheartened and back at a loss as to what im going to do about my occasion which is in two days so much for me wanting to be considerate of your employees theyre paid to do that with customers and couldnt give a sh how they speak to their customers what a complete disappointment

69 at 330pm  i hope your manager sees this because i was so hopeful and excited to have a good experience with this gourmet establishment thinking people in a place called aloha would be friendly i live in a major city and i dont encounter this kind of behavior from highstress gourmet establishments here this has already been incredibly stressinducing for me and i never once spoke without kindness so i dont know where your employees get off being complete assholes people shouldnt have to coddle you for you to regulate your emotions and do your job maybe theyre under stress and dont get proper training who knows i didnt even get to try your product thanks to your gatekeeping attitude so i guess well never know gourmet my ass  this isnt even standard no thank you",2020-06-09 22:50:12,0DUO3H1w76_TFoh7tEpISQ

so i walk in to pick up an order there is no hostess and no one seems to be near the door whatsoever i see a few workers in the back near the bar i make eye contact with one of them but they all pretend like im not there and go back to what theyre doing 

after a minute or two a woman walks in and within 10 seconds someone is walking to the hostess desk and then they say hi how can i help you to her id been there for around 2 minutes standing patiently waiting and they talk to her then once the two of them are done talking the hostess is about to walk away and i have to interject that im here for a delivery and raise my voice get her attention

now was this treatment racially motivated im not sure i have a middle eastern hispanic complexion and the lady who walked in as well as all of the employees within sight at the time were african american 

it could also be that they knew i was a delivery driver seeing as only delivery drivers typically wear masks to eating establishments

either way it feels bad to be treated this way i dont see why its necessary it hurts and as a delivery driver im tired of being hurt",2020-06-23 14:29:18,UzRfRLr3kexhQuePkfvfpQ

 free mall parking on the same level
 cheap products and produce the produce here is definitely a lot cheaper than your big name stores if youre looking for some edible greenery this isnt a bad place to get it
 they have a food court within the market that has bbq chicken which is some of my fave fried chicken ever 

the cons 
 small grungy and disorganized in this day and age where we need to be socially distancing its nearly impossible to do that at this h mart location because the aisles are too small and there are large bins of products blocking the way 
 not the most helpful and friendly staff the two most recent times ive come here ive asked for help to find a certain product and the staff said they didnt carry it when i searched a little harder i found the exact products i had asked for

1.0,"delicious  good service


we ordered togo for the first time coming here their food is delicious we ordered
crispy spring rolls 550
chicken chow fun 13
chicken fried rice 13

we loved what we ordered but we were not expecting to only get 2 crispy spring rolls for 550 a little disappointed they were really good though the chow fun and fried rice was a good sized portion 

good location its very close to the hwy 5 small parking lot shared with other businesses 

happy to find another restaurant we can support and will be back again soon",2020-06-15 02:11:18,hJeQYfE7pHnPowxpoBsx1Q
-1.0,"food was horrible there were carrots in the yellow rice which had a bland tomato taste i tasted no spanish seasoning the mofongo was horrible and they gave me a red flavorless sauce for the mofongo why 

the mofongo was super dry and lacked flavor i then checked in with them on fb  someone suggested the red snapper in garlic sauce it was horrible as well  fish taste old and idk what kind of garlic sauce it was it was not garlicky at all and watery

what was unusual was all the ppl going in and out of there i am left scratching my headand have to sum it  up as ppl who clearly like subpar food or they went in there having had great recommendations from their friends when the food was actually good 

i think they changed cooks and who ever is cooking now cant actually cook i will never go back there ever highly disappointed should have gone to whole foods across the street instead smh",2020-06-16 04:01:04,UoQpdNq0E6dqnajJohPJoQ

1.0,"one of our home improvement projects was to get rid of the original singlepane aluminum 1980s windows to our house and have them replaced with doublepane we had been approached by several doortodoor salespeople and had gotten some pretty exorbitant quotes but opted to instead ask for referrals from friends the best review came from our friends who had used austin pro siding and windows 

our experience with apsw was overall very good our pointofcontact person patrick was very friendly and competent we went over all the products and he helped us narrow it down to our final choice based on budget and needs he was also the one who scheduled everything and followed up 

on the day of the installation the crew came in and worked quickly and efficiently though wed moved our furniture and removed blinds and curtains before they arrived they had to move some of the heavier stuff since we couldnt manage it on our own but they did this without complaint 

about a week after the installation i noticed a crack in the tempered glass for our small bathroom window and notified patrick about it he apologized and had someone come out to replace it as soon as possible though due to the nature of custommade glass it took several weeks 

weve noticed such a difference in our house after replacing the windows i didnt realize how much outside noise got cut down with the double pane how much cooler the rooms stayed in the summer and warmer in the winter the windows are also beautiful and we are pleased with how they look as well

i ordered four different tacos which all came out on corn tortillas topped with their respective meats the meats were very tasty but overall was very dry i would recommend getting a side of salsa and guacamole to go with this my husband had the taco salad which was really overloaded with dressing and kind of soggy on the bottom however it was very delicious the kids each had quesadillas with refried beans in the middle and ate almost all of it
my inlaws ordered two burritos which seem to come out a little bit cold however the seasoning was delicious and they did say they would order it again overall i would definitely go back here just making some tweaks to what we ordered",2020-03-07 23:23:01,lNXIBmFRkQrkxC2dDzKYXg

theres a cute little store that sells all sorts of jams sauces honey and more that youll definitely want to check out before and after the tour plus food and drink is sold in this area they do wine tastings as well i got one of their famous orange creamsicle slushies and brought it on the tour with me which was great

the restaurant looked like it has just been remodeled and the place looked great the table spacing was a little tight for my wheelchair but it was manageable and patrons were very friendly and moved as needed the menu was actually quite extensive with options but we decided to do with the traditional arepas 

the food was made fresh to order and was prompt to come out after ordering the arepas were absolutely delicious very most yet still firm enough to hold the sandwich together the meat was seasoned well and was delicious with the white cheese and other toppings the black beans were also seasoned well and definitely did not come right out of a can the last time i had such a good arepa was when my friends abuela grandmother made them fresh at home

after a steady three days of obsessively checking reviews and picture i settled on enjoy co  im stoked to say that ive found my new local spot 

the work performed was incredible i had long unkempt hair at the time  think tom hanks re castaway sabrina explained everything she thought should be done to correct the situation and walked me through it all step by step the end result was possibly top five haircuts ive ever had and the energy and atmosphere was for sure top three

-1.0,"im not their biggest fan i was a client here from 20182020 and visited a total of 23 times i initially established care here because they were close by and my resin cement had chipped i saw dr wu who rebonded my teeth and gave me a generic clean truth be told i never really felt clean after his cleanings unfortunately within months of his work it chipped again keep in mind that the original cement was placed more than 6 years ago without any chipping which is a testament to the original dentists work i then went back to his thenfemale partner who effectively slapped on a crap ton of cement onto my teeth and failed to resurface it leaving this uncomfortable gritty feeling in my mouth just shoddy rushed work overall thankfully i was able to score a followup is that even considered a win and she resurfaced it so it felt more natural

out of my limited encounters i would say the only silver lining was that one of the two dental hygienist was incredibly good at her job and aggressively cleaned my teeth i really appreciated it on my last encounter there however i did not have her again and felt the other hygienist was not as aggressive and dr wu kept pressing for this deep clean which was effectively scraping your gum line for 50 copay my husband also came to this clinic 12 times and he was pushed to go for the 300 tooth whitening which he did and it yielded no significant result despite compliance crest white strips couldve achieved better results for a fraction of the price

as someone in the medical profession it just felt like this dental practice ran itself as a forprofit where patient care is marginalized in exchange for maximizing profit i did notice some questionable practice on billing ie being billed for debridement that i cant recall or xrays that were not done 

would i recommend not too sure i think a lot of private dental office practice this same ethos so i dont know if you will find better or comparable good luck though",2020-09-14 19:11:13,MG_tqiWM_0ydcnUkj7G7fQ

unfortunately for me my insurance company uses agero agero took over a week to approve my tow because i live in a rural area and i needed my sons car brought to reno for service 
they finally hired arkidian towing services llc you can look them up on yelp also now the rear bumper of my sons car is seriously damaged and his hatch no longer works also his license plate was bent up from the bottom one license plate light is missing and the other is hanging down
agero conducted an investigation meaning they investigated the company they contracted and determined the tow truck company was not at fault the company they hired arkidian took photos of my sons car before loading it onto the flatbed however they did not take pictures after they dropped it at the repair shop agero determined that the shop is at fault because they dont have video evidence of the tow truck driver damaging my sons car now coincidentally the tow truck driver has been fired

-1.0,"i usually post pictures with brand new restaurants but i did not feel that would be fair this case i support austin restaurants and businesses and i totally give this establishment props for trying to open during this pandemic so just to give you all a heads up do not order online my order was lost twice and i finally had to drive there and do it by self order screen which i found easy to use
i want to give a lot of credit to all the server staff who spoke tagalog i am part and the staff for being so nice even though things were hectic
for this review this is all about the flavor we all have first days and this was theres we order 3 different orders at 3 different times and ordered everything from the menu the consistency in time was lacking but as i said in person had a lot more flow hopefully they will see this review and make some changes
the must orders
1 garlic fried rice  why bother with normal white rice
2 lumpia shanghai with pork yummmm
3 lechon kawali 
4 lechon sisig
5 longanisa patties
6 pancit palobok ask for extra gravy and add an order of chicarons to put on top
7 chicken inasal  yum

the mehbee orders
1 pansit noodles great consistency sort of bland maybe they should have an option of adding chicken or pork
2 chicken adobo so this is a standard filipino dish it fell short in the fact that it looked like boiled chicken meat in soy sauce water however the flavor basics are there 
3 dole whip it was niceit wasnt great b it it certainly wasnt bad
4 chicaronstheyre okay 
5 beef tapa this is good if you ordered filipino bifsteckthis is no tapa the flavor is good but they really should add onions and make it beef steak filipino they do need to tenderize or cook the beef better as it was chewy at points

absolutely dont bother

1 barbeque chicken nope nononono this was basically a sour version of the adobo it had no redeeming qualities and again did not make sense

overall the staff was nice the food was decent id go again but that being said if they improve on some of the suggestions

1 pansit palabok add boiled egg and a protein and more of that delicious gravy top it off with those lovely chicarons
2 adobogrill the chicken first then sauce it give the body back to the chicken and not the boiled chicken flavor
3 pansit noodles option to ask a protein and cook those vegetables longer raw cabbage is not good add some salt pepper patis and soysauc the body is there but the flavor would have made me want more

management is not a one size fits all situation this is the first time ive ever asked for a temporary permit for a friend all of these situations should be handled on a casebycase basis and not wanting to leave my child alone in an apartment at night is a pretty acceptable reason for wanting a permit for a single night

now that not as good
the banh mi was disappointing while the pork belly was sick it didnt mix with sandwich maybe i got a dud but a banh mi is a special thing the meat pickles sauces and bread need to have a certain chemistry this didnt like i said maybe mine was a dud i almost feel it has to be since everything else popped so well 

everyone has different tastes i spent 6months in vietnam and lived in laos for a year but the lao banh mi is a different creature than vietnamese one and we dont need to go there today i say this to share i have a decent idea of banh mi and yes we arent in buon me thout we are in the us but still something was lacking

very surprised that the measures for the open air orchards are organized for safety but the confined space of the indoor market and snack shack stand was an unorganized mess mess  no direction on where to enter the marketplace clearly marked anywhere tons of people were there gathering and stopping everywhere no mask enforcement at all what so ever workers at cash registers with no masks or partitions or sanitizers in site people  everywhere dont believe me check out the media i posted 

lynd team  do what you want its your business im just here for people who are trying to follow the rules and still worried about covid and public spaces we thought apple picking would be outside low contact  interaction fun the measures are backwards  why not be more strict on the market measures as you are the orchards

1.0,i dont understand how yelp works in this town there are so many restaurants with four star ratings that totally fail on multiple levels and then there is this place which is consistently wonderful which somehow has less than four stars in yelpland maybe because of people like me who visit all the time and dont bother to write a positive review until two and a half years after my first visit anyway this place has great food great service and is kidfriendly there is a huge menu and always a bunch of specials the freshly baked breads and rolls are delicious we have never been for dinner only breakfastbrunch its always packed but its a big place so the wait has never been long for us  granted we usually go on the early side due to our toddler this is the place we always take out of town visitors for breakfast and its always a big hit,2020-01-01 17:11:51,Nx4DOabJwhJZKOI1IvSaQg

1.0,"tradition and modernity meet tastefully at this unique mexicaninspired restaurant  with a chill vibe inventive menu and excellent service suerte is one of my favorite austin restaurants

ive eaten here several times now for brunch and dinner  the restaurant is classy casual with a vegetarianfriendly menu  dishes change based on what is in season the pastries are delicious my favorite is usually the concha  their ceviches are light zesty and complex their tacos are small but flavorful  my brunch goto is the tamale du jour 

unlike at most newer austin restaurants the servers here are wellinformed helpful and friendly  the prices are also reasonable given the quality and creativity of the dishes not charging outrageous prices for boring modern american food just because they can  most importantly the atmosphere is inviting and unpretentious  gives me hope that not all is lost in the hostile takeover of austin culture

1.0,i was pleasantly surprised by this hand pulled noodle restaurant my experience w hand pulled noodles in the past have not been great they sound better than they tasted because the ones ive had were lumpy and hard xian noodle fixes all this because they have more than one option of hand pulled noodle you can pick what noodle shape you want from thick to thin flat or round into the dish you wanted  they have soup and stir fry options for the noodle dishes my first visit i had the tonkatsu ramen with spaghetti noodles this was a special for that day and it was nice and creamy the second time i had the xian noodle stir fry this was their version of korean jajangmyeon i was craving this and it really hit the spot flavorful and had lots of veggies so whether soup or stir fry big or small noodles you can find something for everyone,2020-01-07 03:41:14,YO7RW77ANgi6H-dlpPX51w

1.0,"let me set the moodi order food like im a host of a foodtravel show but like with less money  i rarely travel outside the us  that being said when i see a menu that is so unique i cant help but order like 50 worth of food for me myself and i

i ordered two arepas with 2 fillings each  both of which turned out to be bigger than the size of my palm  i asked them to give me their recommendations when it came to fillings so i ended up with a chicken and cheese and a shredded beef and black beans  they were both very good but id recommend the beefbeans arepa very juicy and flavorful 

also i cant remember the name of this particular dish but its the one thats the plantain sandwich  everyone just needs to order this dish it is ridiculously tasty so if you see that on the menu get it you will not regret it

the sosos list
the tequenos or the cheese sticks are just ok 

their empanadaswhich actually is more than just soso they have a really yummy corndough and tasty filling but if i had to choose between arepas and empanadasid go for the arepas

the hot dogdont judge me i just really like hot dogs but in this case this food truck has sooo many other wonderful options that this should be a skip",2020-01-29 01:27:17,xQqXx9jGf-YtGg43-BBndA

-1.0,"im having a hard time understanding the appeal of this place yes its a beautiful space but the food and service leave much to be desired with the price point that it is i would expect service to be stellar instead we had a very disinterested waiter who needed much prompting to tell us about the menu items throughout our entire meal our waiter checked on us once and we had to flag him down to refill our water where is the attention to detail here

now onto the foodthe very basic overpriced one note food we came for saturday brunch and ordered 5 plates not one stood outnot one 

we ordered the shrimp tostada carnitas duck mole flautas chilaquiles and the tangerine culler they were decent but not enough to make me want to come back  let alone pay  for such small portions 

the saving grace is their cocktail selection i had one of the brunch cocktails and it was delicious id definitely be up for grabbing drinks here but would rather grab my food elsewhere

seems like they opt for a fusion approach to ramen which caught me off guard asked what they recommended and i ended up with a bowl of ramen with grilled brussel sprouts as the primary topper which didnt gel too much that wasnt even too big of a deal as im open minded but the general broth was lacking in overall flavor

general cleanliness was also an issue in the store our table has food debris after a rough wipe down and the ground under the table was sticky which is always unpleasant was let down by my experience here came in expecting more",2020-02-02 21:50:33,ftfS9Lmugi8FgFwnGjhPKQ

1.0,"this was accidental brunch and a bright spot after a morning of some first world disappointments

the seating inside is beer hall style with a bar  lots of outdoor space but this was february so no comment on that  the staff were very friendly and attentive  the interior being the old firehouse bay is wonderful  only complaint here is that it is loud  some sound baffling would be very nice

we both had the bloody frauen one spicy one mild and they both were very good  even the mild had a bite be warned  smoked gouda an olive pickled green bean and spicy green pepper on top with a little beer on the side  you can drink the little beer put it in your bloody give it to your partner or to the random person sitting next to you  ignoring it would be sad and a waste as its quite tasty

the austrian hash was good but the shaved brussels sprouts though listed as the second ingredient on the menu description were nonexistent  if there they were shaved thin enough to be transparent  perhaps we just dont appreciate the skill involved in the prep here  yes there is a picture  feel free to find the sprouts point them out and make us feel inadequate  and no the green things on the eggs are chives  if you point them out as brussels sprouts you will be made fun of  the dish was tasty but the brussels sprouts were a reason for ordering so a miss there  do add the ham for an extra buck

i unlike my spouse base my order more on the sausage content my mother was german its genetic  the fest platter  sausage bacon hash browns mushrooms eggs baguette tomato jam right  i could not find any brussels sprouts in my order either  since they werent supposed to be there and i didnt want them anyway that was good  the eggs were near perfectly done sunny side up with runny yolks  not yolking they were eggxelent  too much  the hash browns were almost too perfectly done  the bacon was tasty but unevenly cooked mixed crunchy with chewy  im a crunchy guy but bacon tastes good regardless  the mushrooms were excellent except for one chunk of something that didnt look like mushroom  it was also more firm than im comfortable with for the typical fungus parts i consume  in the picture its at the top of the bacon between the egg and baguette if you care to guess  the pork sausage was a tiny bit dry  the tomato jam was tangy tomatoy and jammy

hot sauce and ketchup are served on request  surprisingly the baguettes though tasty and toasted perfectly didnt come with butter or jelly  my wife had already suffered through the brussels sproutoclypse so i shared my tomato jam with her  she is lucky it wasnt bacon jam love only goes so far

this is a repeater  they were breading the schnitzels in the background 
 for later as i paid  the dinner menu is also sausage dense

they might have salads

the best part about my experience was not the food but my server whos name was taylor huge bright smile from the first moment to the last and i noticed he gave the same amount of effort to everyone while i was waiting for my my meal it seemed like he was doing every job in there but still able to make me feel like i was the only one there his energy changed my day around i thought if this kid can have such a great attitude why cant i 

overall this place went well beyond my expectations and taylor is an absolute angel whatever youre paying him i i already know its not enough

-1.0,"our visit to the pem on mlk day 2020 was simply awful i would love to say that i have never experienced anything like the treatment we had but unfortunately that would not be the truth while in the featured exhibit jacob lawrence the american struggle my wife and children were affronted by a security guard note that as in other museums there were no guide wire rope line to control movement and that each piece in the exhibit is protected behind glass my daughter is a huge hamilton fan and she was pointing something out to her mother regarding her boyfriend alex and burr when the guard approaches and says that they should not put their paws on the glass have we no behavior are we animals

of course we left the exhibit before we had gotten half way through and after having a few words with this man why does this man who was so intent on doing his job follow us outside the exhibit it was at this point that i learned about the paws when learning of this debasement yes we had another conversation when questioned his initial response was to deny this when pressed to the point of clarification ie so now you are telling me that my family are liars it shifted to the mistake was ours because we did not comprehend what he said because of his accent this mans response was to classify my passionate protection of my family only as aggression more thinly masked code 

at this point i had no real idea that this man was a part of the security detail this was made real when he felt it necessary to have another coworker to call for their supervisor because of my aggression lol when tyler and john arrive and introduce themselves realization the reality on mlk day 2020 that yes irrespective of your educational attainment or how versed you are in your spoken and written word or the degree of passion you display for an issue on this day of days i am reminded once again that above or is it below all else you are a black man yes i am one however i assure you that i am not that one

john and tyler on behalf of pem have moved to make amends it was made clear that in that regard they are permitted to address my family and their overture was accepted with conditions assurances were made that this employee was way out of line and this would be directly addressed although we had tickets to a guided tour and accepted complimentary tickets to return this day what should have been an experience for far different reasons will be unforgettable",2020-01-21 03:40:28,9GNravR0UzHzSZLP_yPwgw

1.0,we were seated at the communal table which is set up beautifully the interior design of pammys is elegant and homeyperfect for a dinner with friends or a date night we ordered foie gras appthe garlic bread was so good then we split the oxtail pasta which was good but not the best thing ive ever had as well as the caramelle the caramelle was soo good however for the prices the portions were quite small finally we got the apple galette for dessertthe cinnamon ice cream was spiced so well again for the price 14 didnt think it was worth it but it was good service was wonderful however bill ended up being 70 per person also got a glass of wine think definitely could have gotten a cheaper meal somewhere else for the same satisfaction but dont regret coming,2020-03-01 20:49:02,FAmdpqusgZY7Kt3FyfPvGg

1.0,"this review is for their 9pm and after dalan or 打冷 menu  

a good 打冷 menu is wide in selection smaller in quantity moderate to low in cost due to the smaller plates and free congee  sing yee hits all of these bases it is crammed the wait staff will probably rush you to order if you come at 9pm this place is awesome and there are people waiting  at 10pm  we went with a party of 14 occupying the biggest table they have  i tell you its awesome  our wait person clearly knew what she was doing to move us along you might say shes rushing but she definitely has a rhythm to her work to make sure we get our food in a timely manner  and i appreciate that more than anything else      

we had a table full of food and more literally  they paced our food until there was room on our table  we all enjoyed the many dishes greatly which is impressive for 14 people  we ordered lots of hardcore hk dishes that were very satisfying especially because they are hard to find  this is not the complete list

hard to find dishes  
 pig intestines  crispy fried soft on the inside over pickled diakon and carrot sticks
 deep fried chicken joints with chili pepper and salt
 marinated duck chin in soy sauce
 pig blood with chives
 braised beef brisket in clear broth

relatively common dishes
 gai lan with oyster sauce
 deep fried squid with chili pepper and salt
 clams in black bean sauce
 honey garlic spare ribs
 sauteed pork with green beans

enjoy their uniqueness  dont ding them for the rush at 9pm  if you want to take your time come at 1030pm and after",2020-02-19 02:24:28,CNktMooslZ2Lfe905NCNKw

1.0,"well i sure feel like an idiot for not coming here sooner after living in portland for almost a decade i finally made my way to van hanh on a whim for dinner last night 

theres a huge parking lot the dining area is small brightly lit and clean we were immediately greeted and directed to a cute green table and offered menus the server informed us they are redoing the menu and this paired down version is what they had for now i came in specifically wanting pho so i was happy to see it listed as the first item on the menu in addition to the pho we ordered vegan egg rolls to share and my boyfriend got the special noodle bowl the only problem with the interim menu is there are no descriptions  just tiny photos so he was going in kind of blind but he has a strong track record of being a great orderer 

his noodle bowl came out first followed shortly by the egg rolls we both waited for 5ish minutes for my pho because i wanted that group shot for ig then decided to go ahead and dig into the food that had come out im glad we did because the pho took a while i wasnt in any particular rush so i didnt time it but my guess would be there was a 15 min gap between the noodle bowl and rolls and my pho our server told us a few times it was coming so i was glad to know i hadnt been forgotten so it wasnt too big of a deal and we had delicious food to munch on in the meantime

when my pho did come out it was worth the wait there were four proteins included my guesses are a vegan pork beef some sort of meatball and tofu puffs it was piping hot the broth was incredibly flavorful the veggies were fresh and the noodles were perfect 

when we went up to pay the server encouraged us to come back and try the other things on their menu everything we got was so good and i would 100 order them again but im going to keep going back and challenge myself to work through the menu",2020-01-22 22:06:43,P9vqZKBmLCL_WcRjbMNVOA

but the bartender was very accommodating apologized and brought out my correct order within the next 5 minutes and comped it for me the dish and the bloody mary were both delicious and im looking forward to coming back one of my favorite brunch places in austin so far",2020-03-14 19:38:22,rr2PGWJ8tZ3cmHaEzRrjfQ

-1.0,"i have lived here since march 2019 when i moved in i shared an apartment with my brother shortly before our lease ended my brother fell under some personal hardships that meant we couldnt afford rent the leasing office team graciously facilitated everything to allow our lease to end a month early and me to move into a studio on my own


since i have moved into this studio the management team has been completely wiped out and replace with new people


these new people do not care about residents they are very good at making themselves look great until theres an actual problem then they do everything they can to ignore it at the expense of the residents

 

as of may 15th 2020 there has been a leak in my ceiling i took photos and videos as proof and sent them the google drive link to view i kept up communications and let them know when the leak got worse i explained my concerns about possible collapse or mold they seemed unbothered by this information


they barely responded when they did respond it was to tell me that they were hiring an outside contractor who would fix it soon


on june 9th 2020 they emailed me to say the roof had been repaired and asking permission to enter my apartment to fix the cosmetic damage


i did not have the opportunity to respond immediately because i am constantly working  i was asking my boss for a day off to be present for repairs because my cat is a concern when strangers are in my home


on june 12th 2020 they sent someone to my apartment without my prior approval or permission i came home to find my belongings moved and the crack in the ceiling filled in and painted over


on june 15th 2020 a month after the first leak it rained i came home to water everywhere all over my belongings 

i called the emergency number and they did nothing 

i also left a voicemail for the office they did nothing 

i emailed them they have not responded 


they promised this was fixed 


they lied


the management team at this establishment does not care about its residents sure theyll fix a busted light and trim a hedge but when it comes to quality of life they will pretend they fixed it with some spackle and paint and not give a frak afterward 


do not move here the apartments smell of cigarette and weed smoke because management allows people to smoke inside of their apartments people scream and fight almost every night into the early hours of the morning cars are broken into constantly the laundry facilities are always breaking they do not enforce leash laws or picking up pet poop also the roach problem is inescapable because they never have pest control visit even though you have to pay for it according to the lease


this is east riverside and the management team at the social seem hellbent on making sure you know no one gives a crap in this neighborhood dont let the prices the walkin closets and gas stove ranges draw you in 


you do not want to live here",2020-06-17 04:29:09,4lfo2zGktRy9Krb-r8Mz0w

-1.0,i only give one star because the staff was nice i went in and we started putting on my acrylics as usual usually when youre putting on acrylics after applying it you hold down the nail for about five seconds or so just to secure it and make sure they stay on but the lady who did my nails held them on for like one second at most and would try to tear it off just to make sure it was secure but thats not at all how you do it she would keep reapplying the nail and ripping it off without applying new glue so at one point the glue got thick and tacky or a different type of sticky it was kinda like when you would make slime or something and its just before the slime forms and its all sticky and gooey thats what the glue looked like they were absolutely beautiful nails but only a week later i woke up and one of my nails popped off usually my nails stay at least three weeks at least and it was 60 at my regular nail salon which was closed at the time only makes my full set usually around if doing regular polish 25 and if using shellac its 3035 i expected maybe around 4045 because i used a different powder but it shouldnt have been so expensive overall review the place is pretty much horrible and the only thing thats nice is the staff was really friendly,2020-06-04 16:54:15,8f-K6WjLu2S_q6xVhSxjPg
1.0,"the below is a copy from my google review  however i would like to add the following  orthodontics of cambridge has gone through great lengths in ensuring patient safety especially now  upon entering the office you are instructed to wash your hands and then you have a temperature check by katia dr murthy only sees one patient or in our case family at a time in his office since the pandemic  he also assured us of the cleaning g process at the start of the day between patients and close of the day  this reassurance is imeasurable  thank you so much for keeping us safe  

we found dr murthy through our kids general dentist  im so happy they sent us straight here  the office is impressive and modern  it is clean smells nice and katia at the front is very helpful with billing scheduling and any other questions you may have  dr murthy has a fantastic energy and always takes the time to explain the procedures to his patient and like myself the parent we had concerns once braces went on and he made himself immediately available through text and video  thank goodness for the modern age  we still have a ways to go for my eldest daughters braces but so far her improvement is great  highly highly recommend his office  its easy to park at his building in cramped cambridge too dominique cohen mom of rose and  dahlia",2020-06-09 16:38:44,LqM8Eb0tO9BLMAlZB469pw
-1.0,"i was so excited to find doors4homes online i loved the modern look of the doors and there were so many choices i called a few times to ask questions since this was my first time purchasing a door i talked to the same guy every time i called cant remember his name he answered my questions but wasnt particularly friendly when i was ready i called and placed my order with him i paid over the phone and then was emailed a form to sign  he told me it would take around 6 weeks i never received a confirmation email so after 10 days i called to follow up and he said they emailed me a copy of my confirmation and schedule i checked my inbox  junk but there were no emails i actually never received any emails from them other then to sign the contact during the call he told me the door was ready but he needed to confirm when i could pick it up he didnt call me back so after a few more days i called again and he transferred me to jeffery shipping manager who also said it looked ready but still needed to confirm with the manufacture  he didnt called me back when he said he would so i called again the following day and he gave me the number of the manufacture so i could contact them directly and figure out when it would be ready the whole process was really annoying since we were tying to schedule a person to install it and i was getting the run around finally i got confirmation from the manufacture that it was ready and we could pick it up the following friday 1 week later then i was told it was ready i told her we would come monday and she confirmed their hours were 7am11am my husband rented a truck and drove to the location at 730am and the shipping manager wasnt there and they said they couldnt help him for a few hours we already had someone at our house replacing the wood around the door so it was beyond frustrating i called door4homes and they confirmed that the shipping manager wouldnt be there until later  i lost it and let them know that i felt this was the worst customer service i had ever received and at no point did he apologize for the way it was handled he called the owner of the manufacture and the owner got in touch with me after my husband was almost home  he was very nice and said he would meet him at the warehouse to figure it out my husband went back and picked up the door that was the first time we realized that the door came unfinished i relooked at the website and the name of the door was contemporary mahogany which is finished a reddish brown in the image when i expanded the details section below i realized it comes unfinished i was mind blown why on your website would you show the door finished in a color that matches the name turns out the manufacturer doesnt do finishing but gave us a contact who does we couldnt get the door installed that day because now we had to find someone to finish it and we still had to pay our contractor for his time 

to recap

there was no communication from doors4homes in the form of a confirmation email or when it would be ready
i was told someone would call me back 3 times and no one did 
i was given inaccurate information about how long it would take to finish the door the door was ready 3 weeks earlier then it was suppose to be
doors4homes connected me directly with the manufacturer to avoid responsibility and facilitating the final steps of the order
doors4homes never apologized for the terrible customer service
the door was unfinished and this information was not clearly communicated on the website and wasnt clear for a new buyer

to me there is no excuse for this level of terrible customer service",2020-06-15 20:41:49,XKqLcX_4peOgdKEdFwljIA

1.0,"oooooouuuuuu something a little different and new i normally go for the traditional taco shells corn tortilla however their signature parmesan crusted tortilla is exceptionally good  very tasty 

the interior was very nice and the establishment followed the social distancing and precautionary measures amid the coronavirus the staff was nice and friendly loved the different flavors of their craft sodas and had the black cherry 

as for the tacos

tt  carne asada applewood smoked bacon mixed greens pico de gallo ancho chipotle sauce white cheddar and cotija cheese 

boom boom  angus ground beef shredded lettuce pico de gallo boom sauce and potato sticks 

buffalo soja  shredded chicken lettuce buffalo wing sauce homemade ranch green onion and danish blue cheese

out of the three the tt was the best as i like the combination of everything although i dont like bacon but this is an exception as the tastes blended well together my least favorite which was my fault since i cant read was the buffalo soja because of the blue cheese 

overall i would definitely visit again and try out more taco styles",2020-06-29 01:48:11,rAjtcaos8rOnJDJoHVP0Qg

ps we are now trying to return extra material we did not need and even that is a hassle

since then my concerns over a slipping transmission have been brushed aside and i felt like i was crazy each time i asked to have it checked out it will take them all day to diagnose your car for me twice where i had to rent a car from them to get back and forth my warranty on the transmission expired at 60k i really needed them to do serious research to figure out what the problem was while it was under warranty this car has had a slipping transmission and warning lights the entire time i have owned it upon the initial sale when i asked about the ticking sound i was literally told i was hearing things these guys successfully put me off and now my warranty has expired 
i would not recommend this dealership to my worst enemy admittedly i should have walked but because i hate vehicle shopping so much i really wanted to get it over with and decided they would most likely make it right since the car was under warranty and they had a good reputation

-1.0,"very very disappointed 

the menu looked on point and id been hearing great things about this place for a while so i was looking forward to finally trying it out 

my partner and i showed up around 8 pm on a friday and the host tells us its a 30minute wait  completely understandable since its the weekend and we didnt make a reservation about 45 minutes later we go in to check on the table and i see the host running all over once he is back at the stand he ignores us for a couple of minutes during that time i get a text from the restaurant saying our table was ready  mind you im standing right in front of him when i get that text i interrupt him while on his tablet and made him aware i was standing there and had gotten a text once again its friday night and its busyno biggie after we sit at our table for about 1520 minutes and after the two open tables beside us had been seated and greeted we finally have someone come by and acknowledge us he wasnt our server but was letting us know the server would be there shortly that would have been cool if he had come by when we first sat down but not after waiting so long when our server finally comes by about 510 minutes later he treats us as if we had come in the wrong place and that we were an obligation we order our entire meal  drinks apps and entrees since we had so much time to look over the menu 

thankfully the food actually came out in a timely manner but when the first dish comes out we had to wait another 5 minutes to start eating because we didnt have silverware we ordered the muffins they are good but not great i mean they are muffins then our egg rolls come out they are also good but not great not hard to mess up egg rolls then we receive our crab rice and the shrimp and crab gravy the crab rice has about a 34 a tablespoon of crab on top and thats it  not any mixed in the rice only a tiny scoop on the top the shrimp and crab gravy flavor is good and the shrimp were nice sized but the rice was overcooked and some of it was crunchy during this time we probably see our server 1 time and it was to refill our drinks  not to ask us how the food was or to ask if we needed anything as soon as we were done we quickly paid and got the f out 

overall this entire experience was terrible on so many levels

had a regular and a chocolate croissant the pastry tasted bland and old  nothing impressive about the regular croissant  the chocolate one at least had a delicious hit of chocolate in the middle  

moving on to the chocolate danish the custard in the middle was not creamy it was just a clump that held its shape effortlessly again another sign of a day old product 

then the chocolate cake what a disaster  i have had numerous cakes around the metro vancouver area and i have never had the experience of a cake completely sticking to the fork as im trying to eat it  i try to cut off a little bite with my fork and the  whole cake squishes together and sticks to the fork

the reason for the 3 stars though is for the time it takes to get the food its insanely slow

-1.0,"please save your money and do not go here i paid for an entire weekend and received a nightmare in return i paid for the stay which came to 6600 which was the promotional fee and was told i would pay another 5000 upon arrival for my deposit we got there late friday night i checked in at the front desk where the csr promptly took my 5000 deposit then directed me to the back to see the timeshare reps 

when i got to the second office i explained that i had already paid 5000 for the deposit and even showed the csr my receipt at first she said it was fine and the second csr called back up to the front to tell them to stop taking payments this was not my fault nor my problem  then the csr wanted me to pay 5000 again which did not make sense because the first 5000 had already been deducted from my account 

this is when the csr became rude because we argued over the amounts and cards that were acceptable  i demanded a refund and was told to call corporate office afterwards i and my hubby were immediately disqualified from the tour and the breakfast buffet i do believe they find ways to disqualify you so that they do not have to offer the incentives they offer when people come to westgate  it was so bad that the rude and unprofessional csr did not even want to give me my room keys 

we stayed until saturday morning and i tried to find a manager to help me with this situation one manager did attempt to help us but he was not connected to the timeshare side he got nixie on the phone who was unprofessional rude and inappropriate she does not know how to deal with customers and has no business talking to anyone because she has a superior attitude and it shows in her conversations i know this after dealing with her and how other people have had similar experiences with her at westgate i attempted to explain what happened and all she could say was we were told certain things at the time before we arrived that is absolutely not true then when i demanded a refund she slyly replied oh we are keeping the 6600 but we give you back the 5000 then when my hubby asked when was checkout she said it was 1000am again no one at hotel said one word or slipped any note under our door  when we talked to her it was going on pass 1030 we were out of the hotel about an hour later nixie emphasized the point of checking out correctly whatever that means

when i attempted to go in and check out the valet took my parking pass and room key at the front doors he said i should expect my money back in 3 days well that was not true nixie never released my money and how do i know this i called sunday and they still had the 5000 on hold the csr told me she released it and i was done

however today they decided to try and bill me 30000 for attending a tour they disqualified me for to which christopher said at the corporate office was common i was told by irena at the orlando location that only corporate could stop the attempts but that is not what christopher said and he could do nothing to make they stop trying to take 30000 that did not belong to them 

so i do not understand you would not accept the same card for payment for another alleged hold of 5000 but now you want attempt to bill the same card for 30000 for failure to attend a tour that your csr disqualified me for unfortunately i did not read the reviews at consumer affairs and other places on the internet before we went there because other people have had the same experiences westgate disqualified me and husband over a dispute for the promotional tour but now you expect me to pay you 30000 after you told us to leave on saturday i would never tell anyone to go here nor waste your time",2020-01-22 02:30:54,0AxCJfLUmaRzan-_4eKlIg

-1.0,"we have had two separate appointments where i believe the medical practitioners were negligent to address the health of my family in my experience medical practitioners should be treating the patient as a whole not just for a quick fix 

1 the pa prescribed me retinol after my annual sun check after she saw i had oily skin with large pores while this normally would be acceptable she did not ask me questions that are important to a woman in her 30s are you pregnant are you trying to get pregnant are you breastfeeding when i went home and researched retinol i realized i should not be on this rx and the pa did not do her due diligence for my health fyi it is not safe to use retinol if you are a woman pregnantbreastfeeding or trying to get pregnant 

2 my husband came in and complained of symptoms of excessive sweating coupled with gastrointestinal pain the pa prescribed botox in the area of sweating andor a rx wipe that is 300month no insurance covers it the pa was solely focused on putting a bandaid on the symptoms and did not address anything further he got a second opinion who referred him to get a blood test which he was diagnosed with celiac disease causing the sweating and gastro pain had my husband not went to get a second opinion he would have botox and still living with celiac and gastro pain 

i believe this practice only seeks a quick fix without looking out for the whole health of the patient or addressing the root cause of our health 

if you are seeking a quick fix this is your practice if you are seeking to find the root cause of your symptoms or a practice that will treat you as a holistic whole body this is not your practice",2020-03-02 14:25:12,IkgTJQkOrC18YdesKbgwsg

first  save yourself the time and headache you are better off parking across the street at walmart or suntrust i arrived 15 minutes after they opened and both the parking lot in front and the lot next to the restaurant was completely filled up once i walked in i was able to place my order with ease go to walmart to pick up a couple of things and back to busy bees where my food was ready 
 
as for the menu it was your typical soul food spot but i wasnt interested because i only eat soul food from a selected few so i wanted to avoid any disappointment in that area hence me going to the shrimp food dinner with peach cobbler 

the food was cooked to order and fresh so that was a plus but i was disappointed with the portions see my review on krab kings the shrimp was seasoned good 
 wasnt overcooked and flowered just right but size and amount given left a lot to be desired the fries were cooked okay but the seasoning wasnt unique and tasted like checkers fries the macaroni and cheese was decent it had flavor but had that morrison cafeteria sunday afternoon after church taste 

the peach cobbler is where they did good it wasnt overpowering with sugar or syrup they did a light touch of cinnamon had the crust on the top and bottom in the container

2 x2 mac n cheese
3 x2 orange vanilla cheesecake
4 x1 wedge salad

hats off to them for also doing a great job of distancing tables for brunch they were packed so i strongly suggest that you book as far in advance as possible 
as soon as we were seated we were greeted by bobbie who continued to provide great customer service which is always a big deal to me but even more so with covid as i have noticed a big decline in the service at a lot of establishments 
for starters we had the sour cream  onion dip 1965 milk punch and the artemis cup with pimms both were delicious but i do hope for the holidays that they start selling the 1965 milk punch by the gallon as this would be an excellent option instead of egg nog mains consisted of the fried chicken benedict and biscuits with chorizo and gravy both dishes were amazing and filling but we still made room for the bananas fosters beignetswhich are a must

i ordered a ton of cheeses one to 2 ounces each i also ordered a delicious frenchy sandwich everything was so delightful and amazing i was so full from the sandwich i get to try so many cool cheeses that are really special and absolutely unique if you are vegan curious then definitely try out some of the cheeses that are your favorites to see what a substitute might be like if youre vegan then you know the drill just get everything get what your heart desires and enjoy yourself they also had a great selection of wine and beer and i was happy to support them to get a few items to go so i didnt have to go into any other stores",2020-12-04 01:55:51,mIo-tpgxDHl4hLUYg-30xA

1.0,"this review is for takeout only its also just for donuts not the sandwiches after seeing reviews though it looks like we should check out their subs next time we went at 230 pm on a sunday they were out of most of their donuts so we definitely recommend going earlier

its a very unassuming shop nothing special on the outside or inside plenty of parking

we got a half dozen donuts this is what we got listed in order of my preference
 sour cream  delicious
 honey dip  very good didnt taste like honey though reminded me of a krispy kreme donut not a bad thing
 solid chocolate  also very good reminded me of an entenmanns donut also not a bad thing
 sugar raised  decent kind of plain
 cinnamon twist  just okay
 lemon  didnt have too much lemon but im not a fan of lemon anyway

for a half dozen donuts its only 569  tax which is so cheap

well be back and well make sure to come earlier so we have more donuts to choose from its good for the area but we wouldnt drive for it",2020-12-06 20:36:21,B-nz1ZBp9GdevG3pCuLo-A

the food was tasty and very enjoyable fairly fast and truly bubbling hot from the wood oven recommend the meatball flight but order something green to go with it 

however our server karla was noticeably absent and seemed more concerned with cleaning up to go home then wait tables note we were even early for our 830 reservation so it wasnt closing time  had to literally go downstairs and pull her away from rolling silverware to pay the check 

i hear they have dessert but we were not offered any or coffee or refillshad to flag her down for more of that too very disappointing since the reservation was marked birthday and their were presents sogenerally gonna order dessert 

if your looking for a covid safer dining out choice this is a hard pass  we were lucky and our table was just far enough away from the next table since we were on one end of ours and they were on theirs other than that it seemed normal density how close a lady had to ask the gentlemen behind her to lean up so that she could get her coat that overlapped his on the table behind her close enough you had to say excuse me as you bumped diners as you maneuvered the aisles",2020-12-28 03:29:41,aUA7LR3R6ij5xP5G-aQMeQ

1.0,"i havent been out to eat in a minute due to covid i must say delbar was the perfect place for my return to the atlanta restaurant scene everything about it was absolutely wonderful ill start with the atmosphere the inside of delbar was very crisp cool and clean tables were spread apart for social distancing the lighting was just bright enough for a more upscale but posh feel the restrooms were nice too they even play a movie in there  love it there was a very large nicely decorated outdoor area as well which was adequately heated we sat outside they have blankets for you if you get cold  huge perk 

now for the service our waitress rannah was absolutely delightful she gave us great recommendations and she was very patient with us as we were botching the food names all of the servers bartenders and hosts wore masks

we started out ordering drinks and appetizers i ordered the istanbul nights cocktail which i highly recommend it was rannahs favorite and definitely the best drink on our table they also have a wide beer and wine selection for appetizers we ordered the shrimp and the hummus the shrimp was wonderful  so scrumptious that i forgot to get a picture it was the kind of yummy that makes you close your eyes to soak in all of the flavors the hummus was delicious as well we ate it all up

now for the final meals wow im drooling just thinking about it everyone at my table got something different but everything tasted great i really dont think you can go wrong with what you order the meat dishes are quite large so you dont need to order more than one per person you could probably even split the rice dishes are enough for 4 people you absolutely have to get the rice with raisins i am so glad that rannah talked us into that

-1.0,"how many stars do you give to a clinic that almost killed you since zero stars inset possible i guess ill have to settle for one star let this serve as a psa to get your own doctor and to never visit a zoomcare if you value your life there is a reason you never have to wait at a zoomcare they want you in and out and fast as physically possible my obvious symptoms were ignored and i was shoved out the door

after visiting the zoomcare location on mississippi also a 1 star review it was recommended that i check out a super clinic for an xray i was at this location 15 minutes after i left the first location

i explained all over again what i had explained at the previous clinic and they ordered an xray it took a good 45 minutes to get the xray once it was complete i started shaking uncontrollablylater i realized this was probably a spike in my temp the xray guyhe was the only good thing about this clinic loaded me up with blankets and directed me back to the exam room i waited another good 45 minutes and suddenly it became very hard to breathe like my throat was closing off more i was struggling to breathe and because of this is started to panic and my hands went numb i called out for the nurse and explained i was having a panic because it was getting more difficult to breathe

i was injected full of ativan because they thought i was having a panic attack i was having a panic attack because i couldnt breathe i wasnt having a random panic attack they gave me a thick gi drink and told me to drink it i tried i couldnt i explained i could not physically swallow it the drink kept coming up they said they didnt see anything on the xray i was told to take an uber home and rest maybe see a gi specialist within 48 hours 

i thought this was a joke but i took than damn uber home and was left without a car i went home tried to draw a bath and relax i started vomiting and it wouldnt stop but i kept choking as it was happening i was worried i would asphyxiate thank god my mother in law was there to take care of my kids because i called the neighbor and she took me to the er at ohsu my neighbor had become a nurse mere weeks before and she knew i was in respiratory distress within seconds of seeing me seconds once i got to ohsu they admitted me immediately did a quick ct scan and i was intubated right before my airway was completely obstructed from the first zoomcare appointment to my intubation was 6 hours zoomcare wasted so much time if they wouldnt have ignored my symptoms i may not have had to be intubated and spent 5 days in the hospital

my husband was in europe on business and because i was so out of it i was unable to tell my mother in law or him which hospital i went to when he finally found me and the er doctor called him back he was told that the doctors were unable to say whether i would live or die he was on the tarmac on an emergency flight to come back to me 9 hours he had to wait to know if his kids would be left without a mother and him without his parter of 20 years but thank god ohsu was able to recognize my symptoms right away they saved my life if it wasnt for my own intuition i would have died that night

1.0,dr darby is a fantastic doctor  i moved here from florida a little over a year ago and i thoroughly researched all the area physicians  dr darby appeared to be at the head of the class  i booked my annual physical and was not disappointed  the doctor spent nearly a hour with me carefully relating my physical results  the positives the negatives  he gave me suggestions on how to improve my health as well as guidance what to do if this happens  a few months later i had a couple of dermatology issues from another doctor and dr darby took me in on very little notice to address my situation  i highly recommend dr darby to anyone seeking a superior physician,2020-01-16 19:36:26,bpEWqcn4p2dRs9S00yE2Ug

-1.0,"after visiting this location several times over the last year or so i felt like i had to share my thoughts on here first ill say everyone who ive encountered working here was very nice the quality of the pizza varies depending on the day sometimes its as good as id expect other times its a disaster ill try to summarize the pros and cons below and give some examples at the end of the day i will continue to go here if im in the area but i have also been to the nashua nh location many times and its honestly much better id recommend giving it a try but know that it has the potential to be either a great experience or a kind of crappy one  

pros
 nice staff
 ask and are respectful about dietary preferences
 many options for a variety of dietary preferences
 pizza can be good not always
 quality ingredients
 seating areas have always been clean when i dined in
 convenient location plenty of parking

cons
 seem to be some staffing issues ie sometimes appear understaffed staff seems like they could use more training and direction slow service
 pizza quality inconsistent ie sometimes dont put enough toppings on or dont spread them over the pizza enough extremely heavyhanded with the sauces to the point where my pizza has been ruined yet other times theyve forgotten to ask if i wanted a sauce before boxing
 food takes a long time a scenario have been there with no one in line around dinner time and it took 510 minutes for anyone to help me there were already 2 online orders waiting which obviously had to be made before they could start my order at this point there was one person behind the counter assembling cooking and checking people out until other employees started wandering out of the back looking for direction then after cooking my pizza waited on the rack for almost another 5 minutes until i said something and had to ask them to box it i was getting this to go and the process took about 2030 minutes without anyone having been in line before me",2020-01-08 14:15:59,q8OpoqYxkLLtPU9qofJg_Q

1.0,"i am staying at this property for a conference and unfortunately not visiting the disney parks my review is based on business need and not tourist attraction needs 

this conference is going to host close to 1000 people the check in proccess was seamless while we decided to come early and check in i noticed the line did get rather long this is to be expected at this type venue to prepare all desks were open and ready to take each guest as soon as a check in process was completed they noticed i was checking in with a friend and offered to put our rooms near each other which was nice 

the valet process was confusing to me but now that ive done it its a very nice set up the idea is you pull up check in go park your car and go to your room once you are in your room you then call for your luggage to be brought up easy if you are valeting youre car they just park your car and take your luggage all at once nice but that also cost 30 a day i believe that might be a group special price 

the room is great two queens a closet and a bathroom all i need for just me i have a balcony and a desk to do work during the day i think the beds are  comfortable and the ac works i saw other reviews saying it didnt 

the problem with being on the second floor is i can hear the lobby all the time while this might not be  a problem for people visiting the parks all day for someone working in their room this could be a bit distracting i can also hear loud doors slam at all times i guess the rooms arent soundproof  most arent but this is especially loud my neighbors like to come and go a lot that is the reason for the downgrade in stars 

pro tip if you have children or just wished you knew this there is a dvd player in the room bring some dvds or you can rent them from the machines they have on site if you bring a few red  boxes with you its still cheaper than renting a movie through the on demand",2020-01-28 03:40:35,hmUTJKOaB0vI19IRNxELjg
-1.0,"been here twicewas blown away the first time with its nice casual interior and very flavorful food second time walked in to a horrible stench it was not the smell of indian food btw smelled more like bo 

food came in good sized portions but that flavor i had the first time was just not there 

started with good complimentary papad and delicious chutneys spicy onion sweet brown and spicy green

appetizers samosa chaat was very good and balanced kali mirchi tikka was good the first time but not the second it was just not tasty or flavorful 

for entrees we got the chicken tikka masala medium spicy was not bad but nothing special butter chicken medium we got last time was a lot tastier  bhaigan bartha was actually very tasty and probably the best thing here and mix sabzi was okay 

garlic and butter naans were very soft and delicious as always

1.0,"love the burgers and shakes here got el diablo but with an impossible patty and was a huge fan so much flavor and spice from the pepper jack and serranohabanero peppers and the impossible patty tasted so legit definitely spicy though so do not get if you cant tolerate a lot of heat

ordered a kids sized strawberry shortbread shake which was very sweet and yum but definitely perfect in the small size pieces of shortbread cookies made for a great texture

lastly the parmesan truffle fries were good a little too crispy and oily for my preference the truffle aioli dip with them was to die for though

also tried the turkey burger patty that was seasoned with sundried tomato and basil pestosuuuper moist and flavorful it was one of the best turkey burgers ive ever had 

only reason for 4 stars was the service we had 5 people and were seated at a 4chair table and we had to ask multiple hosts multiple times to bring an extra seat or give us a different table",2020-01-07 15:20:02,bzijNu2Kgc9FyjYVVWi7gg
1.0,"i really appreciated the manager reaching out after our poor experience  we returned for brunch on sunday and although it was very busy we were able to grab 2 seats at the bar rather than waiting for a table  we got tasty mixed drinks an oldfashioned and a spicy bloody right away from a friendly bartender  it did take him a bit longer to come back for our food order but he did so pleasantly and gave my husband enough information to help with his decision  

the chicken hotcake tacos are incredible and i highly recommend  the chicken was hot and juicy and went so well with the chili aoli and strawberry salsa  i ate one and took one home to finish later

my husband really enjoyed his country fried steak n eggs  he thought it was cooked well and had a great combination of flavors  

a second staff member came by later to check on us and he poured us draft beers upon request

we could see the kitchen staff working diligently and they appeared to be very organized with the orders

we did have a rather long wait for our meal but i chalked it up to them still being new and extremely busy 

i look forward to returning because the bottom line is the food is very very good",2020-01-21 17:52:30,wZ0KFPTp1263hDl2M0gXGg

-1.0,on december 18 our party of 6 went to the ambleside earls for a celebratory dinner  unfortunately family dynamics sometimes arent conducive to a pleasant experience and one of the guests left prior to receiving our dinner  this was unfortunate in itself but was only exacerbated by the terrible service received   five of the six dinners ordered were received on time   mine was not   i waited for over 15 minutes while everyone else ate  my brother finally asked if my meal was on its way and if not to just cancel it as we were leaving  five minutes later my dinner arrived  the man who delivered it literally plopped it in front of me and walked away after a mumbled and disingenuous sorry  the steak was good but the asparagus tasted like the dish had been sitting under a warming lamp for 20 minutes which it likely had  when the bill came no concession was made for this extremely poor service nor was there a proper apology  i am shocked that a restaurant can find it acceptable to have a guest sit for 20 minutes with no food while the rest of the party eats  i have given this restaurant two stars only because the food was  palatable  i filled out a form on the website the following day and have not received any response from this restaurant   this is another example of the poor service and followup received,2020-01-03 04:18:45,v22xmr_BTVO0LA8ZGk_B6A

they did not have my downtown favorite the cbc cheddar bacon cheeseburger so i opted to try the chicken bacon ranch  good choice for something different  i also had the mac attack which is awesome with that queso cheese

we had bread and butter 10 for a few slices of bread and smoky butter lol scallops the best dish all night lamb shank off the bone and rather underwhelming and the brussel sprouts were spread apart if you combined the leaves it would only make one brussel sprout and pork tenderloin pork was fine roasted parsnips were undercooked with the star of the plate being sweet potato chips

1.0,while trying to find a brunch spot on sunday that doesnt have an hour wait is almost impossible but behold bricks being the one with plenty of seating when you walk in you see yourself all the booths were full but there was plenty of seating at the bar and the bar chairs were extremely comfortable we were helped right away and of course started with the 3 mimosas yum we checked out the menu and decided to order the texas benedict and biscuits and gravy this is the only reason i took off a star because it took the food quite some time to come out saying that i dont know how many people are in the kitchen cooking so that could play a factor regardless we enjoyed drinking most us in the meantime and looking at the cool pictures that they have on the wall they do have tvs that show games and other channels as well once the food came out we dug in my texas benedict was so so so good i was kind of hesitant because there was brisket on it but it tastes like camping and so savory the side off breakfast potatoes were great as well my boyfriend ordered the biscuits and  gravy and they came with a side of an egg and bacon he is very picky about his bacon and he loved it along with the egg and biscuits of course overall the food was amazing overall this place is very reasonably priced we have spent way more on way less food would highly recommend eating here or even just stopping in for a visit for some drinks,2020-01-20 22:09:06,OVn-khRAjS-waP0XI5WolA

-1.0,"i want to love this place its close to my house its one of the only unique american dinning options in this part of south austin and they serve brunch which is hard to get over here as well 

the problem is that every time we go probably once or twice a month since they opened theres something new that just isnt working at first i didnt love that you had to order at the counter and then find a seat but that was fine if it wasnt too  crowded but if you want another mimosa you have to go wait in line again in on the busiest brunch days its really frustrating that no one comes by to check on you 

dinner typically has table service but often were asking for silverware or wont see our waiter for long period of time it seems like theyve had some turn over so that could be part of the issue its fixable

now the food we originally fell in love with this place because of the deviled eggs theyre delicious and like i said not a lot of options for finer dining in our part of south austin but lately the eggs have been very coldto a point that theyre kind of dry and unpleasant to bite into i usually get the salmon with rice for dinner but once recently my food was waaay oversalted to a point that i couldnt eat it and the next time the chef mistakenly  used bbq sauce on my salmon instead of the usual sauce it took so long to find a waiter to ask if theyd changed the recipe it was gross that i filled up on my husbands fries before i could get a replacement

all of this to say i hope the owner finds this helpful i spent 12 years in service and know how hard it is to please everyone but i also know how important feedback is to a small business and to respond to customer needs well keep coming back just to see if things get better",2020-01-18 14:23:18,_eeD_sM-YVFJcxprsCtGZA

-1.0,how the mighty have fallen  i used to look forward to coming here and i always ordered the miso glazed sea bass  it was one of the pricier menu items but it was unlike any other seafood item i had ever eaten  it was so popular that on two occasions i was told it was sold out and i had to settle for something less  it was consistently perfect no matter which yard house i visited  the sea bass was always tender moist  flakey the bok choy was perfectly steamed and the gelatinous miso reduction was rich with flavor  but i went to the yard house at the atlanta battery for my birthday on feb 1 2020 and discovered that the miso glazed sea bass had been removed from the menu  the waitress suggested i try a halibut dish with bok choy instead  the halibut had the consistency and appearance of boiled chicken and was difficult to cut with a fork  it was served with bok choy in a pool of miso soup with mashed potatoes  in the course of fighting to slice pieces of the halibut the miso and mashed potatoes was transformed into a pool of sewage looking gravy  it was unappetizing and i might have eaten about one quarter of the halibut  ill miss the miso glazed sea bass and dont expect to return to yard house,2020-02-02 15:46:22,3sfd07vmCXY7lpWlKENgXQ

1.0,"we used arrowhead painting to paint our house and were extremely pleased the owner  robert came out to do the estimate and gave us quotes for several options all of which were very reasonable  in fact their prices were so good that we elected to go with a higher grade of paint and more colors than we originally envisioned

communication was phenomenal two days after signing our contract the governor put a statewide hold on all construction due to covid19 robert was great all during the time we were waiting for the stayathome order to be lifted he called every monday as promised to touch base and let us know what was happening this was incredibly reassuring and very professional

as a standard part of the job robert set us up with a sherwin williams color consultant to come out to the house which made selecting colors a breeze

once the governor gave the goahead for construction services to continue robert got his crew out to thoroughly power wash the house and they came back the next day to prep scrape prime and caulk

as an example of their attention to detail rather than rushing to get the job done as quickly as possible they gave the caulk an extra day to properly cure before coming back to paint once they were ready to spray they took their time to do the job right giving us two full days of painting instead of trying to get in and out in one

robert himself was there each day to check in answer any questions and look after his crew on the final day they did a very thorough walk around and were more than happy to make any little touchups we asked for although their crew chief had already done his own inspection and the few things we requested were seriously nitpicking

i was very happy with their professionalism the price and the quality of workmanship and would highly recommend arrowhead",2020-06-12 18:25:38,Bm_qo_Cj0vhFrKPkuO1a3w

for working i was disappointed because i had come here for the purpose of getting some work done the wifi didnt work for me after about 10 minutes and there werent any plugs anywhere also there are just a few tables available which generally look like they are reserved for larger parties everyone else had to make due with either counter areas or shared small tables which arent terrible but not the best set up for working also the front door slams shut really loudly and let a lot of cold air in making the table near the door unpleasant",2020-02-28 22:05:54,VPHb-zShxXPczcgbpuF1SQ

-1.0,"this review is for the restaurant in buckhead on roswell road 

weve eaten at the iberian pig in decatur and thoroughly enjoyed it but decatur is a bit of a haul from alpharetta even on a weekend night so when i saw that a restaurant had opened in buckhead i was excited and planned a dinner with another couple we know 

ill start with saying that the quality of the food was outstanding just as it was in the decatur location we started with a charcuterie platter with 5 meats and 3 cheeses there was a truffle honey 2 kinds of fruit spread a spicy mustard and some pickled green tomatoes that were so good we ordered extra

our friends ordered the beet salad the roasted brussels sprouts albondigadas meatballs and fideos broken pasta with mushrooms egg and iberico we ordered the olives the broccolini the duck croquettas and the empanadas and the patatas bravas 

heres where my review begins to go south the restaurant is a tapas based service and they warn you at the beginning that items come out as they are ready not in any particular order but all of our friends dishes came out before ours except our olives it made for some really awkward timing as we tried to stretch our little dish of olives and they tried to eat slowly until our choices were served then all of our dishes came out at once except the patatas bravas which didnt show up until after every other dish had been cleared from the table and wed already ordered coffee and dessert 

but the worst part and the thing that takes this review down to 2 stars despite the quality of the food is that the restaurant is loud and i dont just mean normal crowded restaurant loud but unable to carry on a conversation between 4 people at a small table loud my partner wound up having an anxiety attack in the middle of dinner because he literally could not hear anything at the table and i had to yell into his ear just to discuss menu choices with him as i mentioned weve been to the decatur location and its not this loud its intimate and dark and reasonably quiet for a crowded restaurant so we were completely taken aback at how loud the buckhead location was 

although my partner had the most trouble with the noise level the sense of relief we all felt as we left the restaurant was palpable for all of us we discussed it on our ride home and decided that we wont be going back at least to the buckhead location unless something can be done to moderate the sound levels 

i honestly hate giving a 2 review because the quality of the food is outstanding i also thought our server was great and wasnt to blame for the way the kitchen handled the food but we simply couldnt enjoy the food and the company the way we wanted to and ultimately it was a hugely stressful and therefore disappointing saturday night out with friends it made it not worth the time or the money spent",2020-03-01 20:43:20,K7WKwf6RZ0wjDt2SQ6iL2g

sunday we went to hudson grill and was seated in a booth in the bar area 
after about 10 minutes a waitress arrived to take our order while waiting for our food we observed so many disgusting things the employees were doing

first the bartenders were rubbing their hair pants touching the bar top putting lotion on their hands and the grabbing the glass in which you will be drinking out of  the bartenders not only touch the glasses but they grabbed it in a manner where their fingers were inside the glass just before they poured your drink gross

second the staff was observed several times scratching their head then bringing your food to the table without washing their hands

third we observed a waitress bring a wine glass to the bartender and he stated is it clean the waitress said no the bartender looked at the glass ad put it back on the shelves i couldnt believe it

forth once our food arrived 30 minutes later the order was wrong so this meant a longer wait and more observations

finally the waitress brought our check and she had over charged by 10 dollars her response was me bad please note the food wasnt eaten who knows maybe they just gave to another table

everyone please listen up this experience was beyond gross it shows  me the management doesnt care and allows their employees to put others health at risk with everything thats going on now you would think that sanitation and sterilization would be a top priority however its clearly not

if you choose to eat here pay attention to the employees it will gross you out and probably you will walk out 

please note these are not options they are facts in which i personally observed

-1.0,"this place have completely backward leadership and management role let take an example of the service manager is platon

i talked to him today 01172020 at 135pm
i told him a storytelling
i was there last friday around 1230pm to have them checked my windshield fluid and oil i had waited till 230pm and the car wasnt done yet one of the advisors came and talked to me your car is almost done do you need to  washed  i said yes he continued also we found a nail on your front  driver side do you need it fixed  i said yes of course i need to pick  up my son in  salem at 6pm he said it will be 20 to get it fixed i said why i have been a customer here for a long time and i bought tires here he said  i know it would not be a fee but its our policy i said to himits ok dont fix it please and pump up some air i will go to discount tires near by 

i got to that discount tire near sunnyside and 82nd ave there were no parking lots available because people are rushing to get ready for the snow storm hits the next week so i parked in front the front door i checked in and the advisor there told me  we didnt see this car has been serviced here he saw other two cars but not this one i told them i have it serviced at the dealer he said no worry ill check you in then he said  its be free of charge but you are looking about 3hrs to 4hrs wait he said lots of people are also waiting in front you we are busy today he said  i am sorry 
i told him  i have no choice please go ahead i have to pick up my son in salem at 6pm he confirmed with  me  are you going to pick up your son at 6pm today   i said yes he looked at me and said   i see what i can do please have a seat 
after 45mn waited he came out to me  your car is ready sir have a safe drive to salem and pick up your son 

you guys see it 
that business is even small they could have done like this dealer does to me its just business but they dont they stand by their value and their value is  trust and cooperation if this discount tires keep this leadership behavior going they will always thrive to last 

now turn around to my conversation with platon the service manager at honda  dealer he interrupted me most of the time to get his defensive out from his leadership style he said like we pay our tech to work so we have to charge fees to our clientsor you mean  i dont care about you as human beings or your issue whatever yoohoo seem to have i am here to make profit the more they make the more bonus i will get another part was he said  wowi would have paid  20 to get it fixed beside waiting there for 34hrs when he interrupted me in the middle of i was telling simply amazing right 

if this place faces issues its not the employees and techs fault simply the mistake of hiring the leadership with high performance but low trust people will not follow them around they will do what the leaders said because they have authority over them but they dont follow they have no passion and desire to achieve the vision and goals of this leadership good luck  

updated i have called quincy  guy for a few times no reply back to discuss this matter with me amazing this is my number 5037996462 please call me if you need to discuss with me",2020-03-01 04:02:05,ahRuKgc3F5hDJx_qtD0A4w

 give your waitresses an attitude check  menu proficiency check the girl helping us was clueless and disorganized

-1.0,"i am a regular at this establishment being a transplant from miami i absolutely love the old decor of the pub and the fact that it is walking distance from where i live paul johnny bob and ben all keep the beer flowing as well as the conversation which is why i wanted to take my girlfriend and a good friend of mine there yesterday since it was a busy saturday we waited at the bar for a table to open up and took a seat about an hour after being there this is where everything got bad real quick

we closed our tab and sat at the table thinking we would be helped by the server i saw walk passed me about a hundred times as well as rudely bump into me a thousand times without apologizing once but after about 45 minutes of sitting patiently i noticed the server now i know their name is carry carrie or kerry who cares was only walking up and down the narrow bar in order to get to the front door to leave and smoke cigarettes i counted about 5 times within the 2 hours i was there and these were not quick cigarettes usually a really nice session 

in order to paint even more of a portrait of the amazing service we received our favorite server carry arrie erry at one point came up to our table the first time they interacted with us with two cold guinness asking if they were for us you know youre not good at your job when your customers have to tell you to turn around and serve it to the couple that has been drinking the same beer all night in the corner of the restaurant of course our server wouldnt know that because as they were outside puffing on tar sticks and making sure their shirt underneath their shirt was still cuffed properly the bartenders had to get up from their post and do the servers job for them 

last but not least carryarrieerry came to our table for the first and only time asking are you waiting on me for anything not can i help you sorry i havent been around not do you need a refill which was a bad start i bit my tongue and looked at my beer to see if i needed a refill and as i opened my mouth i was interrupted and asked if i had a tab open at the bar to which i said well yes to which they turned around and walked away the funny thing is i had to reopen my tab because i had not been greeted by my server for over an hour 

i hope this wonderful server is reading this so they learn a lesson to treat every customer with the same amount of respect i own two bars in one of the most popular areas in miami as well as an english degree which makes me excellent at writing reviews for restaurants if you do not want to treat people with an open heart in the hospitality industry especially if they have done absolutely nothing to warrant disrespect as we have all experienced rude customers before then just dont work in hospitality you are losing the bar money and doing nothing to help your own personal growth again i love sevens because it is my local pub but it makes it nearimpossible to go back on a busy night like that if all im going to get is a metaphorical face full of tobacco scented spit from my server and treated like a criminal for no reason quit smoking will ya",2020-03-08 20:20:07,3WHJcnPiySn_hrbiatS3Vw

-1.0,"we happened to stumble upon this place when we were driving by its a difficult location and i imagine itd be hard to access for pedestrians from nearby businesses its a busy area 

the place is new and as you would expect clean and tidy inside the food served to people at the tables looked fresh the staff were pleasant 

we were caught by surprise when we couldnt get a cafe sua da vietnamese coffee at 1130am we needed two stat

im not doubting the quality of the ingredients in the banh mi but its a shock to see a vietnamese restaurant selling one for almost 13  it was a good sandwich but a more authentic version is just as tasty for half the price or less it was a good size but personally i didnt find it offered value for money there were no hot peppers and i wasnt asked if i wanted it hot i normally do 

i enjoyed the taste of the banh mi

we also ordered a vermicelli with roast pork for takeaway we had to return to the restaurant to get the side of nuoc mam sauce that was not put in the bag the ingredients were fresh and the food tasted yum

we were there before midday and the staff were already commenting they were nearly out of roast pork a sign of popularity perhaps 

our family loves a vietnamese restaurant because you can feed a small family relatively cheaply if thats what you are looking for this is not the place for you 

overall the food was good but i might have mentioned its on the pricey side 

will i go back possibly one day",2020-03-15 18:10:15,4yeZwFNPAph5RsJKAuHAnA
1.0,"came here last november on thanksgiving day with my family when they came to visit me in boston the staff was very welcoming and friendly they were so sweet and would make fun conversations with us this place was one of the few restaurants opened on thanksgiving so we made a reservation with the assumption that it would be crowded with everyone else who didnt want to cook for thanksgiving

they have a great deal for their familystyle thanksgiving feast especially when you split the cost with a whole group of people amazing comfort food for the thanksgiving deal you get three courses  each course with several options for you to decide on 

for the first course they let us decide on a salad a nice light start to the meal for the second course you get to decide on 2 out of the 3 options and they each come with a side and a pasta we picked the countrystyle baked smoked ham with mashed sweet potatoes a side of garlic mashed potatoes and spaghetti  meatballs we also ordered the traditional roast turkey breast with giblet gravy  focaccia sausage stuffing a side of mashed sweet potatoes and their famous rigatoni d i personally loved the ham mashed sweet potatoes and spaghetti the ham was sweet and juicy while the spaghetti was flavorful and cooked perfectly the turkey was actually not dry which surprised me lastly the third course was dessert we got the tiramisu and warm apple crostada both were absolutely delicious and ended the dinner off on a high note 

we were a group of 6 and still ended up with leftovers because of the huge portions and variety of entrees it was worth the cost you also pay for good service which they definitely exceeded on we were stuffed afterwards and hit was food coma luckily we had no other plans that night and could knock out right away 

if youre feeling lazy and dont want to cook during thanksgiving then come here with your family and friends  their food is also good in general not just during the holidays",2020-09-10 01:59:36,ZSGjZNF-o3cEzXU6f9Fxvg

-1.0,"cannot be trusted said they would store thousands of dollars of my items which mysteriously disappeared i have been following up for several months to get this figured out and they have zero accountability 


i spoke with them last time i was up here on saturday and their person in xharge of lost and found said you will need to wait till monday to pick up the items  because we have to have the person that put the items in the lost and found come and get all the items that they put in the lost and found together because they put them in different spots throughout the lost and found room and they know where theyre at 

aka it seems as if they wanted to try to get them back because someone took them home

but they added that everything would be okay and they would have everything together on monday and told us to come back on monday not to see if the items where potentially there but come back on monday to collect all the items and they would have all of the items together at that timeto get our items so thats when terry went back on monday and they told him that it was after 30 days and they already threw them away even though they promised us they would not throw them away which is the reason we came the weekend before to ensure that we could collect the items however they said that the 30 30day rule didnt apply because we stayed there a couple days that week before the end of our original 30 day period and they ensured  us that everything would be okay and that they would not throw out the items

i just spoke with them and they said exactly what terry said but i wanted to talk to them to make sure that terry wasnt lying and that there wasnt anything that was misunderstood hat there 

they said that there wasnt anything they could do   he didnt even apologize and they said that theyve already told us that twice now and were completely rude the entire time trying to make me feel like an idiot saying youre asking me the same thing and i was just asking him so how was it our fault when you said it was okay if they stay there past 30 days and how is it our fault when we did come before 30 days and you didnt have them then

and when they told us to come back on the upcoming monday so they could collect everything and  then give it to us all at once we asked why cant we just get what we have now and they said just because and then they change their story to well we cant even get into the lost and found right now",2020-04-26 20:00:39,7ix12NVN377uQmJcELKxJg

after dinner i decided to go upstairs to drink at the bar the area is much more spacious compared to the main floor we had 2 shots of don julio which was about 33 shot i also tried the expresso martini and wow it was phenomenal i will most likely be returning but only because of the friendly bartenders upstairs",2020-01-14 22:07:52,rIsg3EO6AHaSycfowan6OQ
-1.0,"this was my first time at monicas trattoria food was good i enjoyed it but unfortunately the service that i received was rude awful and unprofessional i was going to move on and forget about it but after reading handful of similar negative experiences from other people i had to share mine

it was a saturday night i call in for a take out i order meatballs mussels and pasta with pancetta i receive the food and start to walk home few minutes later suddenly the brown paper bag rips and all of the food falls out on to the street i was simply walking not jumping around with the bag in my hand as it turns out the mussels were not packed properly so the juices were spilling out which made the bag soggy and weak

at this point im only half a block away from the restaurant i pick up the mussels and ripped brown bag off the street and bring it back to the restaurant i try to explain what had happened to the bartendercashier lady in the hopes of them making me a new order as im talking a man that i assume to be an ownermanager enters the scene after overhearing the situation again i try to explain what had happened to him calmly he grabs the mussels out of my hand and the ripped brown soggy paper bag falls to the floor he tells me to pick it up with an aggressive tone i look around the restaurant because i was shocked to hear those words again he says pick it up im in disbelief i look at the lady and we lock eyes she looks away as if nothing is going on this time he says pick it up or i wont make you your food this simple 3 minute interaction could have been handled a lot better the owner was power tripping and tried to intimidate me i never picked up the bag 

in the end they agreed to remake the order i come back the second time and the interaction with the same ownermanager was surprisingly positive he greets me well pats me on the shoulder i get my food we fist bump and i walk out the door 

looking back he was probably annoyed because he thought i dropped the food and i was trying to blame the restaurant for it restaurant businesses are getting hammered with covid and times are tough but the way the owner treated me initially was extremely rude and unprofessional i wanted to be a happy returning customer and i hate the fact that i had a bad experience i love monicas im a regular at monicas mercato ill probably go back to mercato for lunch tomorrow but definitely not trattoria 

side note i had a mask on majority of the worker in the restaurant including the owner did not have a mask on i dont really care about this but some people may so just wanted to include this",2020-08-09 17:08:18,k8Yavy5nEr1adgmWDMV7tQ

the locals seem to love this place as well there were a few tables where groups brought their lunch to enjoy they have a nice grassy area so i can see a picnic too there were also little benches around where couples came to be romantic my friend mentioned she did a photoshoot here before too 

depending on how much time you have you can enjoy the museum or you can just stop by real quick for the view my friends been living here for a while and still havent been inside maybe next time",2020-08-07 16:20:42,W81-CPVrM9c6F8XiNuEUvA

1.0,"absolutely love the staff and the studio i heard about f45 from a friend who is an investor and also takes classes when hes in town and i definitely get why he loves the concept 
i thrive on hiit classes that challenge you mixes things up and gets the job done in an adequate amount of time i do not enjoy going to the gym and spending more than an hour working out and f45 is perfect for that 
this particular studios staff is so welcoming energetic motivating and they take the time to make sure you are implementing proper form to avoid injuries i do not usually sign up for a membership until after a few classes but i already know this is the studio and program for me for anyone that is concerned about going back to the gymstudio f45 has gone above and beyond to make you feel safe by taking your temp upon entering the studio providing sanitizers spacing classes out instead of rotating stations you stay in your area and the staff wears masks gloves and corrects your form verbally without touching you i can not wait for them to get back to a normal weekly schedule and i also hope they bring back the option to buy packs of classes as someone who travels extensively i have a hard time paying weekly for a membership that while some weeks its beneficial and others not so much

both dishes were great the pasta was cooked to my liking and the meat in both were tender and juicy i will say the chicken alfredo was a little under seasoned but i still enjoyed it the pastalaya was fantastic beware the dinner serving is enough for two people but of course i ate one by myself hehe

1.0,"we didnt want to wait two hours to get into franklins so i we chose terry blacks the parking lot looked discouraging due to number of people that also had the same lunch plan idea as us but we found a spot fast as i stepped out of the car i was greeted my a warm welcome texas bbq

this being my first texas bbq experience im partial when i say this is the best austin bbq i can confirm by a austin native and another person that frequents austin that they agree with me too this is a cafeteria style restaurant you wait in line order at the counter they give you delicious bbq and sides exchange the money find a seat 

last step is feasting 

also emphasis on that order dont be rude and find a seat before you order no saving spots wait your turn 

it gets packed here i saw a bachelorette party bbq for a bachelorette party for a wedding located in miami yassss the line wait on a saturday at 1200 was around 45 minutes which snakes around to the parking lot it again looked unpromising but 45 minutes waiting is not bad considering at a normal restaurant youd still have to order your food and wait for it to come out here you get it right when your next in line i was told the line is less during the weekday afternoon

getting to the good part of the review the bbq and sides you cant have one without the other in order to enjoy this experience sides recommended mac and cheese its a no brainer cream of corn cole slow beans the sides are 100 there to complement the meats and they do it best the potato salad also looked good dont forget your banana puddddding 

aaanddd drum rollllllllllllllll the bbq i had a major case of the fomo fear of missing out with this menu meat sold by  13 12 34 or 1 lb between two hungry people we chose 12 lb of brisket 12 lb of turkey and 12 pound of sausage it was a lot of food 13 for two people plus three sides would have been perfect the brisket was heavenly and smokey and delicious the turkey was surprising good the sausage was my favorite that we ordered the beef tips also looked good

-1.0,"youre not going to come here for the sushi but its a nice start to the meal like an appetizer

it took us awhile to figure out how to order from the tablet because it looks like you needed to swipe leftright but instead it was updown wish our waiter wouldve shown us this when she asked if weve been there before
but beyond that the meats came out really fast overall it was good wish the pork belly was cut a little thicker the thin slices made them more suitable for hot pot instead of a bbq grill

i recommend you check the grill from time to time and ask the staff to reapply oil to it after some period of time it started to burn the meats and you could taste it  my fiancé tossed out some good lamb slices because they had the burnt taste to them

for an automatic 18 gratuity charged to the bill i wish they wouldve been a little more attentive especially when we said it was our first time  im not the expert to know that the grill needed another coat of oil to prevent the burnt flavoring",2020-03-06 21:56:45,Jg98QBu-CvF98hha-yQstA

-1.0,"here are some tips that will help you
try to arrive early and make sure you have your reservation done be ready to make multiple lines 
the park has a 50 capacity

we arrived to park around 1100 am 1st line was to get the temperature checked 2nd line is to check any bags 3rd line is to pickupor purchase tickets and the last line before you finally get to enter the park is to scan the tickets this is the part where they ask for proof that you have made a reservation and yes will you need to make one for each member in your group 

after all these lines we finally entered the park at 130 pm the wait time for the rides are a bit longer due to the social distancing and the amount of riders that are allowed however the social distancing was never managed properly and in general the park layout is mess

the breakfast buffet is fantastic and i dont like buffets  they have a charcuterie a wide variety of pastries fruit bar and a hot foods section  if youre diamond you get the continental breakfast included and can up charge for the hot bar 

you are able to go to the wet room in the spa without a charge if youre a guest this is a nice perk after being at the parks for in the florida heat 

the buses run on a schedule and are nice charter buses  they are shared with the hilton next door  the hilton is the first stop when its busy you may have to stand

1.0,"ive been to the farmacys store front in the past and its a pretty small selection of specialty items for the most part however  they have truly embraced the times and stepped up to coordinate one of the most seamless order pick ups with far more options than they can normally house in their store location in collaboration with their local farm suppliers it was a really great way to get access to local food in a time when innovation is most appreciated as is the ability to access fresh food when the normal grocery stores are overwhelmed with visitors 

i will definitely continue to support this great local business that has made things easier in a time when many things are harder

edit apparently the store front has closed unrelatedly they announced this coming change on january 8th due to a failed lease renewal but the business is still running through their pick up at 8505 silver star rd and online ordering the system was actually designed prior to these times and just happened to line up perfectly this family run business is passionate about improving access to locally grown and more organic foods and they have done an amazing job",2020-04-30 16:09:33,iOQRAYKseWzeDrFI0h_TjQ

it confused me why this couple was being prioritized over me who was already paying at the register i am not an opportunist but the couple was white and i am black and it felt very strange that i was expected to keep bending over for a couple who werent even ready to make a purchase strange 

most people would have threw a fit and demanded for somethingim just here to express to yall that you are better off not getting serviced physically by any employee there stu wilson from corporate recommend that i go online and order my items so i wont have to experience this type of service again this is odd because youd think stu wilson would want me to returnbut instead lead me to the direction of no human interaction and to go online and order best buy youve lost yet another customer based off how customer service isnt apart of your actual job i had a horrible experience instore and stu wilson from corporate recommend a virtual experience totally unexceptionable that has to change asap to hr training and development is impeccable and you should always strive for excellent customer service experiences the guest shouldnt feel intimidated to purchase or feel
compelled to accommodate someone frantic workers needs sabrina and alicia i was ok with the compromise but alicia youve truly lost me as a customer and ill never respect her business decisions ever again offering me a free screen proctor isnt going to make my experience any better i was harassed from the line and hustled the entire time sabrina never let someone influence your customer to walk out the door it was your duty to make sure you presented a professional and pleasant experience and you let alicia convince you to treat your customer as if they have the flexibility to come back wrong move honey dont get into sales with this type of tactic",2020-10-28 17:36:25,PpIi8bTkkezGMM1aP5TN8A

i got there and around 530 a server came out and asked if wed like drinks a good thirty minutes after hed been sat  i pointed to the margarita the guy by me had the goblet like at mexican restaurants and confirmed it was a margarita  i said id like that but with salt on the rim  my boyfriend asked what beers they had confirmed there were no ipas and asked for a negro modelo with a lime  the server said she thought they were out of limes and shed see if they had the modelo  we requested an appetizer at that time as well 

fast forward ten minutes and the server comes back and says shes sorry but she cant remember if we had placed a drink order  this is 40 minutes after weve been there and we are on a babysitter schedule  i say yes and remind her of the margarita and the beer    she returns a few minutes later with a small margarita no salt as she sets it down she goes is this right and i said no i wanted what he had she said well its the same amount of tequila just a different size drink and his cost more so its a win  then she looks at my boyfriend and asks him to remind her what his drink was  

at some point she came out with the appetizer and two waters  

around 550 she came back to see if we wanted to order and still hadnt gotten my boyfriends drink  we said no thank you we were going to eat elsewhere and wed like our check  while i finished my small margarita we waited a good ten minutes and the check never came  we finally decided to go inside to pay

i missed the conversation with the first person my boyfriend talked to inside but as she was walking into the kitchen i heard him say it was just an app and one drink then a man comes out of the kitchen and we assume he knows were frustrated  instead he says youre here to pick up an order correct my boyfriend says no  were trying to pay for our items  the guy asked what we had and my boyfriend says forget it  heres 20 thats a 50 tip and she deserves 0

-1.0,"i have taken my husband here before during covid and was satisfied with the barber and the precautions  however i was very disappointed today when i took my husband in for an appointment and absolutely not one employee had a mask on in addition to no mask none of them were six foot away from other workers  the customers getting services did not have masks which is acceptable if the employee performing the service would have been wearing a mask  also all guests that were waiting in the lobby did not have masks on  including kids did not have a mask on  i escorted my husband outside as he has medical problems and is high risk and i went back in to question the desk receptionist  i asked about the mask wearing and he was very kind and said he could ask the barber if he would wear a mask for my husbands service  he replied about why they were not wearing masks as after awhile it is just too difficult we chose to leave and cancel due to the risk that would have been involved of being in the place with no precautions being followed  it is interesting that they have a big sign on the door saying that masks are required and they also had a covid 19 precautions certification sign  not sure exactly what that said as i didnt tatar in long enough to read 

covid cases are rising and organizations like this should take every precaution to protect themselves and the people they serve  there is no possible way for a barber to keep a six feet distance while performing this work and if they feel it is too difficult to protect everyone they encounter they should look for a different profession 

btw my husbands last two experiences at this  place delivered great service the barbers may do a good job at their profession but should also uphold the protection necessary",2020-10-31 18:22:20,LQAwmibi-Vpyt3yCnRYGKQ

as of right now theyve set up a virtual queue where you show up and give them your phone number and theyll text you to come back after a certain time took about 3 hours before we got the notification to return and then we waited in a physical line for about 1015 minutes before entering the store fortunately we had plenty of other places to check out so it wasnt an agonizing wait

the exterior alone is amazingly themed featuring antique style window displays and a gargoyle on the roof the interior is something else entirely youd think you were at an actual theme park with the level of theming and detail on display gothic style caricatures line one wall with bookshelves on the others theres special lighting effects and even a bit of smoke effects 

as for the food its really as good as everyone says huge half pound cookies packed with chocolate its every kids daydream theres a bunch of different varieties with special holiday limited editions they also sell cake slices and cold brew coffee definitely a must see if you get a chance

we enjoyed the pool which is toddler friendly despite the fact that my son got mildly ill after swimming in it its not marriotts fault that he drinks pool water

breakfast is free and adequate though it gets redundant after two days  i wished they just had some bacon instead of flacid sausage patties and overcooked canadian bacon the english muffins are a nice touch though for people like me who enjoy breakfast sandwiches i know an egg station would be too much to ask for from an american three star hotel so i wont ask the mickey waffles were legit take notes magic moment and we loved having the ability to make our own waffles instead of taking the previously made ones from the pan oranges and apples were standard as was the orange and apple juice the coffee was drinkable 

other things that were nice were the spacious parking lot for the mammoth of a car that we rented the storm trooper elevator which our son loved responsive housekeeping the small albeit overpriced convenience store for essentials and the helpful staff the location is excellent and the roads by the hotel are quite calm in comparison to some of the mega roads in orlando driving to the disney parks from here is a breeze 

besides the redundant breakfast buffet the only other issue we had was not being able to checkout late this was not anybodys fault and i would imagine most hotels would not let us checkout at our desired time of 3pm 

overall i highly recommend this hotel for anyone trying to spend less money on their disney vacation",2020-03-06 20:18:53,1vAkDr0smBPFq6R3IFQw0g

1.0,"this review is based after my second visit to sulmona the first time i went my friend got sick you can actually see his review below and so i was hesitant to go again but i thought things might have changed in 2 years this time it was with a group of about 15 people the interiors of this restaurant are pretty cool and they have a good drink menu i had a cocktail the first time but this time it was just food

we ordered several antipasti and main course items including a pizza i myself ordered the burger cooked rare with fries note that if you want an alternative side other than fries you could only get the house salad which was average the food arrived in a reasonable time the presentation was average like you would find in any other restaurant they didnt break any significant ground the burrata with pesto was good i tasted some of it the burger was not bad it was made rare and i could taste it well the condiments on it were okay i would say there was too much onion on it it met my expectations of a burger but wouldnt say it exceeded my expectations 

overall id give 4 stars for food 4 stars for the service and 4 stars for the ambience i usually allot 50 to food 30 to service and 20 to general atmosphereambience the average comes out to 4",2020-02-28 02:05:53,W4n-LVI6J_wUOec8slub_w

-1.0,"a couple of good girlfriends and i met up for brunch here yesterday after learning of the 2hour wait for a table at milk  honey on cascade rd when my friend suggested that we could go to the social house instead and there was not a wait for a table on a sunday i was skeptical to say the least nevertheless we decided to meet there 

the menu was typical of a brunch menu with the shrimp and grits or tilapia eggs french toast pancakes toast etc one thing i really liked seeing was the vegan options on the menu as a person who doesnt eat beef pork or chicken i was happy to see other options such as the food impossible burger as well as turkey sausage and bacon 

i was deciding between the turkey burger or the shrimp and grits suggested by the girlfriend who suggested the restaurant however the server recommended the salmon and grits which sounded yummy  so thats what my friend and i ordered our other friend ordered  the shrimp and grits 

our entrees came out about 20 minutes later and as you can see from the pictures they looked delicious hmmm not so fast the first bite of my grits i was utterly disappointed my grits were luke warm and so were the grits in the other two entrees i tried to stir down to the bottom to see if the heat was down in it but it wasnt the salmon was decent but not good enough to make up for the barely warm grits the texas toast helped to bring an extra needed flavor to my salmon but overall i just couldnt get into my meal 

dont get me wrong im certainly down to support black owned businesses and im also down to hold them accountable for their quality and service service was phenomenal  food was not i did not complain or send for hotter grits because i didnt want to make a big deal out of not enjoying my food when my friends seemed fine however im a foodie and enjoy trying out new restaurants in ga first impressions are lasting and unfortunately cafe social house doesnt make the cut for me",2020-02-24 16:23:50,Hgv7sxkgT9-usNEJcUG9Vg
-1.0,"i really like this store used to shop here all the time during this pandemic as a sewist i learned they are giving away precut fabric to make masks to donate for hospital workers i went in with my significant other  teenage daughter both of whom sew well

1 they only gave us a bag with material cut for 5 masks five i can literally sew 5 masks in under 30 minutes that alone makes this a waste of the gas it cost to get here 

2 and this gets me the most irritated its 1 bag of 5 masks per group not per person so although myself my so  my daughter all sew we were only allowed 5 masks so 15 minutes of work flat how ridiculous we should have walked in separately i guess 

3 the lady who dealt with us was grumpy as hell we were never anything but polite but i got the feeling she hates the folks sewing masks for the hospitals 

im sewing them primarily for a local hospice who desperately needs large numbers of masks what a shame this joanns is compared to other states ive heard most states give a bolt of fabric for this purpose will definitely be bringing my business elsewhere",2020-03-25 03:04:54,8pTLV_6Hh3FjwZoWOJQ-yg

-1.0,the food is subpar shrimp scampi sauce was too sour and lack flavor the pasta was mediocre compared to olive garden to add insult to injury i ordered extra chick parm to my pasta sauce since this option was available online and got charged for that but ended up not getting it because they cant do it in that way why the hell did you allow customization like that online then my other dish was made with lump crab sauce but i can barely see more than 2 shreds of crab meat you can probably find more crab meat inside a hermit crab shell than in this dish this place is a joke i rather buy boxed pasta and cook it with prego sauce and it will still be more satisfying than the food here  they will not even offer me a credit and lied that it was only 1 extra when it was actually 3 more with the chicken parm even if they offer 50 discount i still will not order from them again  i was even kind enough to tip them for this pick up order,2020-05-03 00:43:48,JJYGMHrIn1ORdYj7naHgFA

1.0,"upon reading some of these reviews and hearing about these bad experiences i felt the need to say they are incredibly inaccurate and should not deter you from visiting the canine classroom steve wes and ray have completely transformed my dog cocoa from being an aggressive stubborn dog to being an angel on walks 

i started bringing cocoa here when i was 16 and she was 5 i did this back in 2016 for a couple weeks and started noticing differences in her behavior almost immediately but because life started getting in the way for me i stopped bringing her her problems continued because i didnt put in the effort to fix them and bring her back 

my dog was incredibly aggressive upon seeing any dog she would growl and bark and lunge she would also make this weird screambark that was super embarrassing and frankly scary i got her when i was 11 and i quickly gained anxiety from walking her i was worried that as a big dog she would pull me down in attempt to attack another dog  which she had at one point to say i was discouraged would be an understatement 

this year she is now 9 years old i decided to bring her back i called them up and they gladly helped me set up an appointment in late march it is now mid may and i have a completely different dog in such a short amount of time her dog aggression is almost completely eliminated just today i had cocoa walking with two other dogs and she had zero issue this may sound small to you but i had never been able to do that before no more barking no more lunging or growling 

i wish i wouldnt have stopped bringing her in 2016 she is so much better and its thanks to the trainers hands on approach not only will you see improvement in your dog you will see improvement in yourself they trained me to train my dog one of the reviews complained about how they didnt make house visits to train their dog thats not their job it is your job to train your dog they just teach and show you the tools to do it but at the end of the day you have to have the motivation to do it when you get back home i didnt have that in 2016

another review talked about how there style was super cookiecutter and that is so far from the truth they listened to what my problems were with cocoa and then started there they took cocoa out of the classroom into a field with other dogs and transformed her i saw her go from an anxious mean dog to a relaxed and kind dog all of the trainers here have treated me and my dog with respect and i will definitely be bringing my future dogs here 

if you are serious about getting your dog trained come here you will absolutely not regret it",2020-05-16 20:11:24,eyha1KMzrnsE00ZM-9nNoA

their contract requires you to vacuum and wash the car before returning it it has to come back clean or they will charge you

it made me wonder what benefit to the rental company would you get by renting out a smaller car instead of making your customer happy especially when your customer was right senseless and i will never spend another dime with nu action car rental i found out the hard way why they have a 24 star rating stay away scammers",2020-07-09 16:46:31,Ng9_akvvrlgr5-fYkhCGpw

the cherry on top was the technician that took the swabs he was not wearing gloves and his mask was sitting in a very strange way on his face meaning it wasnt covering mouth and nose area properly

1.0,"bulla was a great find on a saturday we came during happy hour and were sat on the patio which was great we ordered food when our waiter came to initially greet us and we were eating within 10 minutes or so pretty impressive the only reason im knocking a star off is we tried ordering a potato dish at the start of the meal which had been forgotten and then were told it was out of stock when we asked about it towards the end of our meal but then we tried ordering meatballs which were also out of stock so we just ended up getting dessert instead 

the food
cheesemeat platter we ordered goat cheese and chorizo both were really good with the goat cheese being a stand out loved the candied walnuts as well

patatas bravas delicious potatoes covered in a mildly spicy sauce we were big fans of this although it was a little spicy and im terrible with spice

queso fundido the queso was good but im not sure i would order it again there was chunks of tomatoes in it which i thought was kind of odd but it didnt hinder the cheese taste too much

ham croquettes my personal favorite cheese potatoes and ham in a fried square whats not to love 

churros the churros were a good end to a fantastic meal

but as a consumer you have to remember your sales person will not be there on your move day although i forgot to mention how eric was very quick to answer all my texts and phone calls throughout the entire process and time changes so next acknowledgment goes to our driver phil  wow  what a smart efficient team leader that made the move so easy  phil always knew where our stuff was located where he and his rig were and kept us very aware of the route along the 10  he was precise about the arrival time of our stuff and a really nice guy that was easy to get along with

she made sure everyones needs were met and made sure to give realistic times for drink and food orders but was able to get them out steadfast while maintaining quality

a few of my stand out favorite dishes were the sio mai hao gao chinese donut and the sweet bbq pork buns although everything we had was delicious

1.0,"this was another doordash success  i placed my order earlier and requested it to be delivered by 530 pm  the driver was here at 525  perfect timing


for this meal we ordered the spaghetti and giant meatball and the ravioli lasagna

my son loved the spaghetti and meatball  he said the meatball was one of the best hes ever had  coming from a picky eater thats a huge compliment

i had the ravioli lasagna  it was amazing  packed full of flavor the perfect amount of raviolis the red sauce was not overly sweet and the meat on top  added just the right amount of spice to the dish

the bread was the final part of our meal   the artisan bread was perfect  just the right  vessel to soak up what little sauce remains

1.0,"i recently went to barcelona for the first time with two girlfriends from work my two disclaimers are
1 i am not a wine expert or even a wine enthusiast except in the sense that i like to drink wine all we ordered was wine and everyone liked their wine
2 we were only able to try 7 tapas between the 3 of us limited by our stomach size so the items im basing my review off are patatas bravas brussel sprouts beef empanadas grilled hangar steak albondigas meatballs a charcuterie board murcia  a goat cheese mahon  cows milk cheese chorizo and their churros dessert tapa

my favorite tapa was probably the brussel sprouts followed closely by the patatas bravas and beef empanadas the brussel sprouts were a perfect mix of individually crispy leaves and tender whole sprouts the patatas bravas were also very crispy like fancy breakfast potatoes with an excellent gourmet ketchupgarlic aioli mix the ground beef in the empanadas was extremely well seasoned and the crust on the empanada was flaky crisp and fluffy the meatballs and hangar steak were solid but not outoftheballpark amazing the cheese and chorizo on the charcuterie board were delicious but not worth the hefty price tag for the amount they served ive gotten better and 5x bigger charcuterie boards in france for a small fraction of that price 

the churros deserve a separate paragraph of their own the dark chocolate sauce was the perfect accompaniment but i couldve eaten 10 more of those churros without any dipping sauce they were clearly freshly made judging by how piping hot they were and and so crisp but so fluffy and tender on the inside wow best churros i have ever had the only bizarre thing is they were not even on the menu the only reason i was able to enjoy this miraclechurro was because my friends had them before and asked

the service was fine on average we had some very nice servers but there were two experiences that made this not a 5star experience first even though we had a reservation and there were a plethora of empty tables they would not seat us until our full party was there and we werent late 2 of us were actually early why make us hang out awkwardly instead of just seating us at the table that is already reserved for us this kind of hosting is especially irritating for punctual introverts like myself also there was one server who kept bugging us when we were trying to hang out and chat asking are you ready to order yet repeatedly maybe she was trying to be attentive but maybe more than 2 minutes between each checkin would be nice

all in all a pretty great dinner experience with some room for improvement some of their other menu items looked amazing and i cant wait to go back to try some other dishes like their paella the croquettes prawns etc and more churros definitely more churros",2020-02-11 23:37:58,CoJ5LKzaTcB5J1FFj4wiMQ
1.0,weve had take out several times and its been good just dined in for the first time and was pleased even better fresh off the stove and im happy that their curries are made with no fish sauce this is not typically the case and as a vegetarian im always disappointed when this request is not able to be accommodated the only negative was during the payment process they added 18 gratuity for a party of four which is not typical i was fine with that part and wouldve added a little more on top but the signature receipt was really deceiving it suggests tip based on percentage of the total which included the subtotal and the 18 gratuity wish i wouldve taken a photo as it was confusing and misleading just be careful if you dont look at it closely you might potentially add 30 tip not the best last impression but i think wed still go back given the limited asian food options in the area with a variety of vegetarian dishes,2020-02-16 23:35:02,CeaPlfDG_88J6j6vpkg-Xg

salads were good  we ordered steaks as our entrees my husbands steak was a perfect medium and i had asked mine to medium well and it came out as medium rare tried to get someone to tend to us which seemed forever  our waiter finally came back and carried the steak back to kitchen  the manager brought the steak back to me which looked like a complete mess on the plate she did comp me a cocktail after about 20 minutes  dessert was okay nothing special  the next morning my husband and i were sick from what we ate

1.0,"great glad to see that jws reopened 

the ambiance was nice quiet and relaxing the interior was full of relaxing muted colors with blacks and grays the place is easily accessible as it is in the center and in michaels mall 

appetizers we got oven roasted meatballs and fried calamari
the meatballs were good they were very big would have preferred 4 for a party of 4 however they were decent again but i have had much better the spice was out of balance and i am not sure if there was much breadcrumb used but i felt that that ratio was out of balance as well nothing negative on the calamari fried crispy golden and drizzled in a sauce also fried with banana peppers which give them a nice kick

entree i got the deluxe meatloaf 18 and truffle fries 8 completely overpriced completely it was good though and very rich it was drizzled in a thick gravy with portobella mushrooms and covered with a piece of apple jack smoked bacon the bacon was amazing the meatloaf itself was fine however similar to the meatballs i was tasting way too many spices the 18 price point must be changed i understand that this is a nice dish but i would say 1416 would be more appropriate but what do i know the truffle fries were ok for 8 a complete and utter waste of my money oily thin and overly spiced thats all i have to say would have rather got a plate of collard greens 

overall ok there were 47 items on the menu and 9 appetizers too many if you ask me i suggest to narrow it down nice night out with friends",2020-03-05 01:46:44,tD_6K2Cp35BhmyDh-nJDUw

their 3rd party agero who dispatched a tow truck that 25 hours later was still looking for us to find out he was more than 2 hours away dispatched in the wrong county state farms 3rd party finally sent another tow truck that with the help of my son from 400 miles away found us after the tow truck loaded my vehicle and we finally began to the service station that was now closed on a friday night the tow truck broke down about 10 minutes later the conversation between my tow truck driver and the owner of the truck company chris bassett towing was on speaker and while i sat in his vehicle with my dog the owner said he was going to sell that truck since it had issues but he sent it for my emergency instead hours later another tow truck came to tow the tow truck and the owner came in another truck after the owner had his broken tow truck loaded on his other tow truck his plan was to dangle my vehicle and take both however his broken tow truck didnt fit on his other tow truck and my vehicle was left down the dark dirt road with the doors open while my dog and i wandered the dark waiting the broken tow truck was unloaded and my vehicle loaded onto the 2nd tow truck chris then came to me and wanted his payment for the extra milesi was still on the side of the road hours later and couldnt believe he was worried about his 42 i told him when he gets us to the repair shop ill pay him he was mad and told me he has 3 trucks there 4 me really his broke down truck was his problem he tried to make it mine billy had to collect 66 instead of 42 before chris would let him drop my vehicle at 3am this all started with chris bassett towing at 9pm the night before 

the shop i was taken to gill auto group was also recommended from state farm their 3rd party as i had no idea where to take the vehicle they gave me options from their preferred vendors i chose a dodge dealership since i own a dodge 
after my vehicle was towed to gill auto group arriving sat  2120 approx 2am the service department opened abut 8am i was told there were only oil change techs available and i would have to wait till monday 2220 for a certified mechanic to diagnose my vehicle i had to check into a motel as i was in transit from wa state to az monday came and went as the appointments already scheduled had priority  on tuesday 2320 still in a motel corey in the service department said i needed a throttle body map sensor and iac connector  a fuel regulator i was quoted 990 until my son contacted corey in reference to a coupon on the gill website for the repair after much back and fourth corey honored the coupon that brought the estimate down to 84973 after a full week in a motel waiting on my vehicle i picked it up on 2720 my vehicle was out of their shop and on the lot i paid the bill of 84973 and continued the next several hour drive to az shortly after my arrival in az on 21720 my vehicle did the exact same thing it did was i broke down and was towed to gill auto group in madera ca as i was waiting for a tow truck i called gill auto group and spoke with corey who told me my parts are under warranty and even though im now in another state the local mechanic can fix it however the mechanic in az who is a 50 year credible master mechanic from aj  bills big daddy garage in bullhead city and 3 of his master mechanic associates informed me that the work i was charged for at gill auto group was not preformed aj explained that the iac connector  map sensor were not changed they were covered in grease grime and dirt which would not be present if these parts had been replaced aj did note that gill auto group  did change the fuel press regulator yet did not even clean the throttle body injector or fuel filter which caused the breakdown in az aj cleaned the throttle body and confirmed it was not a new part  aj said the only reason the vehicle made it to arizona was because the fuel pump sat long enough to cool off and would basically be ok until it got too hot again which is exactly what happened within a week after i arrived in az",2020-03-10 23:46:47,aBE8SoTlbWgXWUKaCO9cAg

1.0,"im not a local but simards is one of my wifes personal must stop places when she visits her home town  having lived near boston for several years i appreciate that while you can name a number of new england delicacies the secret of the locals is that the roast beef is the goto sandwich is king  in philadelphia i lead people away from the cheesesteak and to a roast pork w sharp provolone natch and in massachusetts you can skip the chowder or even the lobster roll and go right for a super beef  

pros

i have no idea what else is good on the menu except this  we order 2 roast beef sandwiches and spicy fries w cheese every time  im never disappointed  freshly sliced melts in your mouth and a nice soft onion roll are truly bliss  i love it  

my goto is a regular beef about the circumference of a big mac with lettuce onions horseradish and mayo  its got the right spiciness to still melt but have a kick  i love it  

my wife skips the horseradish and enjoys hers as well  we also get the spicy fries and cheese which are about exactly as youd imagine  eat those fries hot because theyre pretty unspecial cold  

prices are fair

i ordered the super beef once about the size of a whopper and even in my hayday of eating a shit ton its a bit too much  you can probably stop it at regular beef if youre hungry

hours are extreme for late night  service is friendly though  

cons

service is slow for drive through  lol if you order delivery  they cook and slice to order so it is what it is  

the fries once not hot are a mess  just a potatoey kinda gross mess  eat em quick

this place looks pretty dingy and old  but honestly weve always enjoyed it and never saw anything gross happen 

conclusion  we can and will be back  simards hits the spot for a local roast beef joint and the extra late hours are probably why it stays in business  but simards does the trick for us",2020-01-10 17:41:54,kaOV2JYS0-hdGm0ce3AIDQ

1.0,"my first reaction was that this menu contains the most haphazard collection of sandwich options i have ever seen its like someone made a random sandwich generator and let it run wild 

but then i noticed that this was in fact the point and then i began to appreciate the genius behind the concept

each sandwich is designed by a local chef paying homage to the cuisine of their wellknown restaurants it felt a bit like a celebration of the local food scene a way in to what the city has to offer this is a restaurant borrowing the formula from the music industry this is the putumayo of sandwich shops and i liked it 

prices are a bit high which given the back bay location isnt all that surprising i got the dbar which clocked in at 22 a pricey sandwich but it was quite good 

the facade is a bit underwhelming but i found the inside to be cozy and comfortable we washed down our sandwiches with some czech pilsners",2020-02-12 00:19:50,QDbk642MouaxSTD7owGkow

-1.0,"not surprised to see this particular location gets such a low rating we stopped in to grab a couple salads and were absolutely disappointed from start to finish im sad i didnt check yelp first we ordered two of the same style salad one with chicken one with carnitas they came in two different size and shape of containers lucky me got the smaller one however much to my husbands dismay they totally skimped on what was in his container we have been getting these salads at another location before we moved from hillsboro and had never received such a sad looking salad for what they charge its almost robbery the dressing cup was only 23 full however since the salads were minisized there was plenty of dressing to go around  additional points of disappointment were that they didnt give us chips with our meal like we have historically become accustomed to and we got to shell out an extra quarter for a paper bag to bring our food home in sherwood charges a nickel 

the one good thing since it was dead in there and they were preparing minisize portions our food was ready super fast 

bottom line we wont eat here again",2020-03-11 01:41:34,0jmNWmwqZb-0eSOb_4UW1g
-1.0,"i hate leaving negative reviews but i was very disappointed with my dining experience
i took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner because hes been wanting to try out some french restaurants in the area hes also a culinary student who is very knowledgeable about food quality and restaurants 
i made a reservation for us 3 days prior and when we arrived the table that was reserved for us was in front of the door next to the host stand luckily they werent very busy and let us pick another table there appeared to be only on guy working the front of house which wouldve been fine but he appeared overwhelmed with 4 tables 
we ordered our appetizers  mussels in a white wine cream sauce escargot and mushroom soup those all came out fine aside from the server mixing up who got which appetizer which is no biggie the mussels were perfectly cooked but lacked acidity the escargot and mushroom soup were great sadly it was all downhill from there we were advised that if we wanted to order the soufflé for dessert to order it ahead of time because it took 30 minutes to make so we ordered it when we got our entrees while we were waiting for our food my boyfriend noticed one of the cooks walk out of the kitchen in a tank top and apron we were shocked one would expect the cooks in a fine dining establishment like this was supposed to be to wearing a chefs coat or at the very least a t shirt anyways for our entrees we both ordered the lamb with blue cheese sauce and veggies the server forgot to bring us the salads that were supposed to be included with our entrees the plating was so boring and half assed the lamb had no sear on it but even without it wouldve been much better without that blue cheese sauce there was way too much sauce and it was so strong that it overpowered the lamb the mashed potatoes tasted good but they were super dense once we managed to finish our entrees the soufflés came out and i wish i had taken pictures of the atrocity it appeared to be cooked on the outside but once we went in for the first spoonful we realized that only the outside was cooked and the inside was basically a chocolatey soup we waited for a little bit to see if our waiter would come check on us but my boyfriend ended up flagging him down being the culinary expert my boyfriend is he knows what soufflé is supposed to be like but because we are non confrontational people he asked is the soufflé supposed to be this runny in the center the waiter looked at us like we were stupid and said well it is supposed to be a little soft in the center but we can cook it longer to your preference if youd like we politely declined but were so dumbfounded our server acted like we were in the wrong saying its supposed to be a little soft as he watched me drink my soufflé the mashed potatoes and my mushroom soup were more dense its a shame that i had such high expectations i would not recommend this place to anybody sadly my boyfriend and i both work in restaurants and know what its like to get a bad reviews when its not deserved and we do everything in our power to address our guests concerns but this place deserves this review definitely not worth 165",2020-03-11 03:23:46,sC5MRN5ft-Xwp3ohi9tsGQ

-1.0,"terry blacks is a decent texas bbq place if you have never had texas bbq before the location definitely works in their favor because its convenient near downtown with a decently sized parking lot its a nice place to experience our bbq here for the first time but know that there are much better places with most likely less of a wait 
the mac and cheese and green beans are their best sides and brisket is their best meat however their brisket is lackluster without a lot of flavor but it is moist 
youre able to grab a whole bottle of wine and drink at dinner but expect the markup they have great local wine beers and ciders to drink with your meal 
this establishment and family has a lot of history in central texas among the barbecue scene which i respect but taking that out of consideration i  think terry blacks is overrated 
but dont let me stop you from enjoying your fave bbq joint its just not my spot

the steak was savory as expected the outside was slightly charred and it was tender and juicy inside the coldwater lobster with the freshfromthesea taste was remarkable no need to get your fingers dirty as the assistant manager came over to our table to deshell the lobster for us

when we got back to our hotel to eat the chicken had oiled up the bag quite a bit all the meat was pretty juicy but we were surprised by how nonspicy it tasted the crystal hot sauce packets really amplified the flavor we werent all that impressed as it tasted like average fried chicken
when we opened up our pie it was not a chocolate chess pie were still not sure if they gave us regular chess pie or sweet potato pie because it just tasted sweet it was good but very sweet

-1.0,"ill give it three stars but im a little bit annoyed right now the server ran someone elses 170 tab on my card of course she caught the mistake and issued the refund now i am waiting patiently to verify that my account is appropriately credited

a friend was in town with a group and they decided to dine here the reservation was for a large party i have about 20 people so i knew the things remove a little bit slow

i was the first person from the group to arrive so i had a chance to look around a little bit the host at the front door was polite and even offered to check my umbrella the restaurant is very spacious which allows for a lot of floor space for dancing i can see the appeal of this

it was raining so the party was seated inside naturally service was slower due to the party size again that was to be expected   
and the beginning or server you did well with drink orders when i was only about five of us present once orders for tapas begin things became a little hairy

as far as i know all of the correct tapas were presented however they didnt seem to have a system in place to indicate which plate belong to whom the servers assisting did their best to get plates to the correct guests with a small number of missteps i tried the gambas al ajillo empanada de pollo and skinny margarita
the empanada and the margaritas were good  the butter sauce for the gambas was too salty for my liking 

i dont recall our server coming around to specifically asked if we wanted to order another tapa or another beverage however when someone caught her attention order something else she promptly took the order and the item came back and fairly decent time

a few people from the group participated in the dancing but most just watched like many of the other patrons 

overall the experience was okay with exception of the card annoyance it is possible that i would come back provided there are no issues with my refund",2020-03-05 15:56:42,gXLTS8ftydM1Bsta7VPD-w

dont judge a dish by its simple description cold noodles with peanut sauce and toppings   these are chilled ramen noods so delightfully springy and loaded with refreshing toppings cucumber tomato slice bean sprouts seaweed salad sweetumami marinated pork one plate could easily last me two meals but i stuff the whole plate down because it tastes and feels soo good 

the first time i came here i was meeting up with friends but had already eaten earlier  i tried a nibble of my friends cold noodles and could not stop  she is a very generous friend and let me eat my fill  in less than a week i was already back to eat my own full plate of cold noodles

four stars because the awesomeness of their cold noods does not transfer to their other dishes  i tried my friends tan tan ramen and while the broth is unique chicken based the noodles dont have the cravable spring in the hot broth  we also tried their gyoza side dish which came in a delightful green gyoza wrap but lacked flavor  so cold noods ftw",2020-03-09 20:03:13,5QnQOiFGlQ9afOT-EU0xAQ

the husband ran there this past weekend best donut reviews in the immediate area so we had to give them a try  

according to him the gentlemen on staff were extremely friendly and as it turns out eager to please  id requested a white cake donut with white frosting and altho they didnt have any avail at that moment they offered to quickly ice a plain cakevery cool  as for our other selections a couple old fashioned a couple raised yeast and 2 cakes  

the yeast donuts were not goodthe icings were good and the reg glazed even had crispy edges always a fan  however they actually tasted of oil never a fan  

the white cake white icing was pretty good although the icing wasnt the normal icing one expects on a donut  it was softer and slightly sweeter   to be honest it was a bit odd but didnt taste bad  the old fashioned selections were on par with similar at most donut shops

-1.0,"very strange experience i went here for a drivethru covid test though im pretty sure i just have seasonal allergies  a young man emerged who appeared to me to be wearing a poorly secured drugstore paper mask i rolled down my window to receive instructions as he was speaking to me he got closer and closer until i felt like his head was practically poking in my car i politely asked if he might step back a few paces social distancing and all

his response was oh were going to get way more invasive than this i asked if he would be wearing only his thin paper mask during the invasive part of the encounter given that he spends much of his day around people who have um covid i thought it might behoove us both to have him properly protected

he said well if you want i can go get suited up and from behind his paper mask he seemed quite annoyed at my insolence i said no need and drove away 

i cant speak to the rest of the clinicbut i dont think you want to catch covid here i mean get covid tested here

-1.0,"this is a complaint for global luxury suites aka churchill living aka global serviced apartments

this business conducts itself in a frankly criminal manner i would recommend that anyone aggressively avoid conducting any business with this umbrella group which operates under multiple names and that proper authorities investigate their inappropriate business practices

after an uneventful but generally positive corporate stay in one of their units at 345 harrison ave in south end during summer 2019 we decided to leverage the group to have 3 separate sets of elderly parents from california and minnesota stay with us from apr9 through jun2 in stays averaging 12 weeks this family was to provide support before and after the birth of our first child in midapril

shortly after booking with churchill living the massachusetts governor issued a stay at home order as did governors in ca and mn as all of our family is over 65 with preexisting conditions and given that massachusetts requires all out of state visitors to self quarantine for two weeks before interacting with anyone in massachusetts and given that all family would have averaged about two weeks of stays we decided to cancel our reservation and request a refund

we figured that as airline and hotel chains were issuing refunds due to hardship during this time it wouldnt be controversial to for a 9 month pregnant mother and her husband with no in state family to support them to receive a refund on a reservation intended for family visiting to help us with our first born

what ensued is a case study in corporate greed slumlord style tactics and actions that all but confirm criminal intent on their part this would have all been horrible if we werent already dealing with the anxiety of expecting our firstborn during the peak of the epidemic in boston due date of 4112020 and the uncertainty of whether husband would be allowed in the delivery room with me or not

on mar19 churchill issued a promotional offer of no cancellation fee for their units at 345 harrison ave with advanced notice of 7 days prior to the start of a reservation

when i reached out 10 days prior to the start of our reservation for a full refund cancellation they made sure to first charge my credit card for the full duration of my expected stay before responding to my cancellation request they then claimed that i was doing business with a different entity global luxury suites aka gsa and therefore was ineligible for the promotional full refund even though their email receipts and oncall hold music on their corporate phone lines declared them to be churchill living

thinking i had encountered an ill informed low level employee who certainly wasnt acting in the spirit of the firms values i sent a private note to the firms ceo yudel kahan appraising him of our circumstances and assuming that he would approve our refund given the extreme circumstances we found ourselves in no response no acknowledgment of refund no cancellation of charges

when i confronted their billing department with a screenshot of their full refund cancellation policy they went radio silent until they could change the policy on their website before responding to me see screenshots in my book and in most courts this willful altering of policy after confrontation is an acknowledgment that their original promotion applied and that i should have been eligible for a full refund but still they refused to acknowledge a refund and cancel charges

on mar31 as the state of massachusetts refined its policies in response to the crisis i pointed churchill to the the state policy that ordered no one could reside in a hotel for vacation or leisure stay even for reservations beginning after mar31 still no acknowledgment of refund or cancellation of charges

then the truly despicable reality emerged churchill had been evicted from 345 harrison on apr1 according to onsite staff there was no way that churchillglsgsa could have fulfilled their agreement with us even if we hadnt cancelled at first they denied the eviction even though we saw them moving furnishings out of their units with our own eyes 345 staff confirmed the eviction and credible witnesses saw a constable post eviction papers to churchill units when we confronted them churchill tried to flip the narrative and state that we are responsible for payment up until the time before their eviction claiming that we had checkedout on may 6 this last event shows that churchill wasnt negotiating in good faith and made an offer under false pretenses

in sum given their complete tone deafness to covid and our personal circumstances multiple flagrant attempts to sidestep state policies bumbling attempts to cover up their own policies and the completely nauseating act of attempting to charge us for a rental unit that they can conduct business in good conscience truly despicable",2020-05-28 16:55:39,2rS7mm2WqZM975eB5liLTw

i have been to more authentic restaurants in the lower mainland and i think they had a more impressive menu with a better quality food ajisai toshi and momiji to name a few maybe saturday evening is not the right time one chef one kitchen staff and one waitress who brought blank menus twice 
just to be fair though the seafood was fresh nigiri sushis fell apart easily and the chicken karaage was undercooked
i also felt cheated when we were charged 20 for salmon oshi when it says 15 on the menu 
i mean if youre here you might as well go to 101 other sushi places on e hastings but if you end up here because you see have given it 5 starts dont get disappointed like me",2020-06-28 04:00:50,bejJg5ELZWZk_h66t_g9rA

the server came over to take our drink order and i asked for a wine recommendation all i said was i wanted a red with some spice to it and he brought me exactly what i was looking for

we started off with the octopus the tuna crudo the prawns and bacon wrapped dates 10s across the board 

the tuna was light and citrusy with just the right amount of salt

the octopus was cooked to perfection not chewy nor mushy and the flavorwow

the peppers with the prawns brought the perfect amount of heat and the blue cheese was a great addition to the dates 

we then went on to order okra sardines chorizo beef tartare and fois gras 

every bitedelicious the food alone would have resulted in a 5 star review but the service was just as amazing our server fidel was a rockstar he was kind speedy and even brought us a beautiful birthday flan we enjoyed his company so much we wanted to  invite him to join us

pizza ponte is located near the amc theatre near the bridge close to stk it is connected to maria  enzos think they are the same ownership but not for sure also be forewarned that they close really early in the day right now their hours are 128pm sunday through thursdays and 129pm on friday and saturdays we came on a weekday about 1015 minutes before close and had no problem ordering anything we liked on the menu however there were probably 30 or 40 people trying to get in the restaurant as we were sitting outside eating i was honestly surprised they closed so early considering how many people were still out looking for dinner options

when youre in the restaurant you order at the counter i ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza 725 and all you needed was one slice it was huge and was very good my partner ordered the chicken parmesan sub 995 and he said he wished his sandwich was a little bigger but was still good as well we also ordered a caesar salad to start 9 and was plenty big for two people to share

-1.0,"i have been waiting for this place to open since last year and it finally opened in may i visited this place last week place has ample parking space they are open for dine in however majority of the crowd is taking takeouts 

if ur looking for a covid safe space where all precautions are being taken then this is not the place people were not wearing mask group of people were being cramped up in a small space where takeouts were given concept of 6ft does not exist 

i had given an online order paid in advance and set the time for the order to be collected in an hour we received the message in half the time that our order was ready but when we went to collect it our order apparently was not ready i was trying to minimize my time by just collecting the take out but now i had to wait 45 minutes for my order in a place where people were not wearing mask however the guy behind the counter apologized and gave me complimentary mango lassi as a gesture i was happy that atleast he realized there was a mistake on his part 

we tried variety of dishes its good to have a indian place around but the food was average and very oily i love indian food but the food has far too much oil 

1 chicken 65 this was my favorite thing out of all the dishes ordered curry leaf flavor just added to the taste it was not too spicy and chicken was soft and flavorful i would just visit this place for this dish

2 gobi manchurian  too soggy and too sweet

3 hakka noodles flavor was good but too much oil there was a layer floating at the bottom

4 chicken tikka masala  there was no tikka just pieces of cut sautéed chicken gravy was light yellow sweet and it looked it they used butter chicken gravy an authentic chicken tikka has capsicum pieces and is a bit spicy but both the things were missing from this dish the order comes with a portion of white rice 

5 chicken biryani  2 big chicken pieces flavor was average and again has too much oil

6 garlic naan

7 plain naan

the day i had visited there was a regular influx of people for take out orders sometimes in this rush food quality can be compromised so would definitely be visiting again",2020-11-13 16:36:27,3qCI9Oqxy_FDJO-z9HT7gA
1.0,oh my god this place is so good i am a new vegetarian and i do not even miss chicken because i feel like i am eating a real chicken sandwich its actually the best chicken sandwich i have had in general my only complaint is how much weight ive gained having this pop up down the street during quarantine but i cant come at them for that,2020-07-19 01:22:27,KLTQDdc1-okuE2DmO-q70g
1.0,"pabu has proven to me that it not only deserves to be in the conversation with the best sushi restaurants in boston but as one of the premier dining experiences in the city

i actually got the idea for dining at pabu from a travelzoo voucher that i got for my wife and myself on a whim i had not heard of it prior to and after i got the voucher started researching the chef location and what dishes they were best known for 

the menu is diverse and offers a lot of interesting dishes that can be easily split among a few or numerous people there is also a very interesting menu of sushi that is exclusively imported from japan and immediate surrounding waters giving diners the opportunity to enjoy the fares of the japan without actually visiting the sushi menu and small plates were where we settled on for our meal having a more tastingstyle approach to our dinner than getting bigger plates and only getting to try a few things 

oddly enough the tokyo fried chicken was one of my least favorite dishes and i still really liked it there was nothing we had that wasnt perfectly prepared and presented to us at the chefs table end of the sushi bar highlights of the meal were definitely the housemade tofu maitake mushroom tempura and the sashimi selections we made from the japanese fish menu 

from a price perspective pabu is more than reasonable where some multicourse sushi experiences will run 150person without drinks i think our total bill was under 200 including two drinks for each of us as well as tax and tip 

the service and attention we got was exactly on par with what we expected we were given the perfect amount of attention without feeling constantly interrupted or ignored which i think they appreciated hearing when asked how our experience was outside of the food 

pabu can easily fall into the special occasion kind of meal but you can also be choosy and have a great meal for a more than reasonable tab i think this will be added to the rotation for sushi as well as special occasion destinations going forward theyve proven to be a powerhouse in an already crowded sector and were able to wow the wife and i during our first visit",2020-03-02 18:26:58,rNkUINslsz6e-ah2L634sA

items tried

lavender black tea 55  5
taste their teas are always super fragrant and delicious  especially if you love floral teas like myself i recommend this onethe rose tea
portion size 24 people

house special grass jelly 55  795
taste the house special came with milky shaved ice grass jelly mochi taro balls vanilla ice cream and fresh taro it was made simply but it was also delicious more on the sweeter side
portion size good size for 2 people

i am not providing this info over unsecured email for a piece of exercise equipment and why didnt you collect this info when i placed my order over the phone to avoid delays my parents ordered the nautilus treadmill shortly after i purchased this itemand i will inform them to cancel right away ive been on hold  two hours and counting

to test out my theory that nautilus cares more about sales than customers after theyve purchased i also called the sales department from another line guess what i waited less than a minute and sales rep susan howe provided awful service once i explained i wasnt interested in purchasing rather needed help on an existing order eventually i was rerouted to a voicemail to the customer care line

-1.0,"this company is a complete scam 

door knocking hustlers door knocker gloated how much he makes on the deals so he doesnt have to work other than a few months a year complete bullshit 

     do not use them no matter how much the door to door salesman harassed you 

tell them to leave your private property or they can be charged for trespassing 

i paid over 700 dollars to have them come out 7 times all they did was kill my grass around the perimeter of the house i rent a home and when we moved in there was an obvious problem with roaches and insects that we were unaware of so i went out on a limb and tried this service if anything the problem only got worse over the past year after being on hold for 28 min to cancel the service i was told they would charge me another 280 to cancel even though there was only one service left in the contract 

i can not express enough what a freaking scam this company is if you see them in your neighborhood tell them to leave your area immediately and dont let them waste your time 

until i receive a full refund from the beginning of service i will continue to write these reviews on every platform i can use to ensure that my neighbors do not get cheated like i did

1.0,"i would say mariel is more of a new cubaninspired restaurantbar rather than a fullblown authentic cuban restaurant to enter the downtown boston scene you would find atmosphere inside to be quite similar to lolita or yvonnes supper club since its operated by the same company expect similar dim lighting interesting art piecesdecorations and good music while youre there its not too hard to find this place due to their bright red led logo right outside

coming to the food and drinks

cubano pizza
crispy toppings soft base and packed with a lot of flavor its a smallpersonal sized pizza but definitely a must try if youre bored with traditional toppings we all need some excitement in our lives sometimes 

coffee  doghnuts dessert
even though its a coffee cheesecake but based on the texture and how light it is feels more like coffee mousse but the idea of balancing that with lemon glazed churros is just amazing topping off your lunch or dinner with this dessert will definitely be worth it

cigar cocktail
its their take on a traditional old fashioned and if the original is your goto drink then youll definitely like this one its your nononsense cocktail basically

trogon cocktail
mezcal and lime in short what can possibly go wrong here refreshing to say the least and comes with a flaming lemon slice its one of those drinks that when you buy it people watching you just want to go for without asking much

overall your experience here can be a hit or miss depending on the number of people inside who likes to stand or wait for a long time these days would definitely recommend getting a reservation if you plan to go on a weekend night as it can be really crowded during dinner hours especially after 9 personally ive had some good experiences here and the staff was very courteous so i would definitely go back to try some of the other interesting items on their menu",2020-01-02 06:13:51,rE7TZdr53Yfa-gg06kXP4g

side order was also really good mac and cheese is very cheesy and not dry at all cream corn was very sweet just the way it should be peach cobbler was warm and gooey 

everyone was so friendly and welcoming just like anyone in the south should be  this is a perfect last stop for our 3days experience in austin and we are pretty pleased w it",2020-01-13 18:46:13,iA_7Ek8zvH1tXVRQtk3L2A

-1.0,"this unassuming restaurant failed to live up to my expectations but it was still okay 

the bell dinged as i entered the venue and i looked around to see a beautiful painting of the buddha etched into the wall the cashiers were busy taking what seemed like multiple online and phone orders from customers so i figured this place was going to be good i ordered garlic naan and chicken tikka masala to corroborate the  other glowing reviews of it it comes with rice

the food took around 20 minutes to arrive i was unexpectedly faced with an abundant basket of garlic naan and unfortunately my food was placed in plastic containers and came with a paper plate and plastic utensils i was hoping they would place it in porcelain places and silver utensils the naan was nice and fluffy but didnt really taste like garlic the chicken in the chicken tikka masala was surprisingly moist unlike most chicken tikka masala ive had however the usually deep tomato taste was lacking here i did like the consistency though finally the rice was fine but it wasnt the basmati rice i love 

but i still scarfed it all down",2020-01-08 01:36:24,nYcuVT9QI1NVVsOp2PN8tw

-1.0,i was warned about the food being overpriced and the atmosphere being tacky but my curiosity and love for italian cuisine rendered me a patron of this restaurant tonight the calamari seemed quality and tasted alright but the rings were huge and thick when im eating calamari i want finger food style so i can pop a ring in my mouth and not have an absolute mouthful its very unappealing that way i chose to cut it up into quarters the rings were so big irregardless good luck getting the breading to stick to the squid if you dare make an attempt to dip it in the marinara such a chore hardly worth ordering as a quick appetizer meant to be eaten while its hot the service was bland as our waitress didnt seem to have any recommendations or really even seem welcoming at all considering we were first timers thats a flat out bummer right off the bat i ordered the sliced sirloin steak with a cabernet wine reduction and mashed potatoes i dont mean to slander when i say this looked like boston market gravy sloppily thrown together with an abnormally tough sirloin i know sirloin is no filet but come on youre charging 2300 a plate give it some value huh an absolute disgrace to italian cuisine how do you mess up meat and potatoes i ordered the broccoli as my side for what i believe was a 300 up charge and it was an entire head of broccoli the entire stock attached uncut and simply tossed on the plate almost as if they were to say you cut it and it tasted frozen which the manager replied with our produce comes in fresh everyday listen ive worked restaurant my whole life and thats not how produce invoices work you dont get broccoli in everyday thats just asinine whether it was frozen or fresh im not 100 sure what i can tell you is whenever you take a bite into a stock of broccoli and you can taste a seemingly unnatural water like substance burst out its likely it was frozen just calling it like i see it there were no garnish on any plates save a balsamic drizzle over the bruschetta which doesnt even count because bruschetta literally calls for balsamic overall a very boring display including the dishware which sounds a bit nit picky but paying high prices should my expectations not be high too the bruschetta was halfway decent but ive never met an italian that melts provolone cheese on the base of the bread instead of topping it with fresh mozzarella seems like a cheap americanized way of making bruschetta and its wrong because youre not giving the people their moneys worth but you certainly are still charging them i look forward to visiting the restaurant that replaces delmonicos when that time comes and based off of my experience tonight i believe it will happen sooner than later,2020-01-03 06:53:57,PbZY4QvbBiBuHsPtZX_szw

in orlando for presidents weekend so its a tad crowded we were told the wait would be about 20 minutes around 2pm but my phone buzzed maybe 10 minutes later letting us know our table was ready 
esteban was our server and he was greatattentive and informative 
we started with chicken lettuce wraps i hate mushrooms and asked esteban could they be eliminated but its a premade mix and that couldnt happen he let us know that they would be chopped so finely that i wouldnt know they were in there he was right they were good the bean sprouts added a nice unexpected crunch im used to p f changs lettuce wraps but these are different know that the lettuce isnt crisp iceberg so dont be surprised 

i wanted wings with my beer but all flats was not an option so i went with a burger and i think the universe knew this burger was the better choice  omg i kept seeing burgers pass by me because we sat close to the open kitchen and they looked amazing i landed on the wisconsin cheesy burger no lettuce or tomatoes ok im picky   it was cooked to perfection nice warm pink center at a medium well temperature and the parmesan fries how do they keep so much of the parmesan cheese on the fries they were amazing

i was stuffed by the end of the meal i didnt even finish all of my tasty fries

there is a bit of everything in the menu plus some daily dishes worth to try everything is a la carte the meal started with a small appetizer complements of the chef to get our appetite going  for appetizers we ordered 2 daily dishes  tuna over avocado mouse with pate and seafood appetizer portions small but enough as a starter for entrees italian combo which seems to be a fixed in the menu  1 large ravioli and small piece of filet mignon lasagna this is the only dish i thought for the price they could have served a larger portion  the duck breast was so delicate with a blueberry or blackberry sauch cant remember and i accompanied it with a side dish of asperagus  the fish over pasta was good but again the portion of the pasta could have been a bit more
for dessert we got the white chocolate soufflé which we ordered from the get go as it takes time to prepare  i am not a fan of white chocolate but this soufflé was good
overall the experience was fantastic although deducted 1 star because for the price of a dish such as the italian combo 40 portions could have been a bit generous",2020-01-08 18:34:18,ame9YUi0LjCTBi9Gl87-ng

i made a reservation for sunday brunch and we were seated at the bar everything is pretty much bar seating or window bar seating no tables which can be a bit awkward if you are not a bar type person  luckily i am a seat at the bar person  we probably could have gone without the reservation but it was rather full at times probably recommend a reservation for a sunday around noon  

the drinks are creative beautiful and of course very very tasty  i had the casino royale which they describe as a remixed old fashioned by way of monte carlo with chocolateinfused whiskey benedictine black walnut and angostura bitters served with a nice big block of ice   it was one of the best old fashions ive had i could sit there all day and drink those but of course the food was amazing too  we started with the blue cheese stuffed dates with pancetta amazing  this was followed by a savory crepe the provence which included brie roasted asparagus mushrooms spinach lemon aioli everything was delicious we left stuffed

food here was genuinely impressive i had the old fashioned with candied bacon and maple vanilla which was legitimately outstanding perhaps not the most generous portion but the flavor was dynamitewhich considering it cost almost as much as my entree is at least notable speaking of i got the pub burger sans cheese because of lactose issues and truffle fries and was also genuinely impressed my medium burger was closer to rare than medium but it tasted wonderfulagain for a 18 burger i was at least genuinely impressed 

all in all id certainly come back here at some point if for nothing else than to explore the drinks menu some more they brew their own beer too which i didnt get a chance to try i gotta admit i am put off by the prices hereas a new yorker im used to being ripped off but everything here was about 3 more than i would have felt comfortable paying for at a pubstyle restaurant off a highway i know everything here is off a highway but i cant help but get olive garden after dark sort of vibes from the decor here but as i said everything was genuinely above average so i guess thats what passes for fancy in orlando",2020-02-29 03:31:36,SQIfkwKkwH_iD-urr0Fiew

first of all they didnt have any normal bourbon or whiskey at the bar only sweet flavored whiskey and no normal vodka or titos only infused vodka so if youre looking to drink anything other than wine or beer dont go here 
2 the food wasnt as good as the other location we got the tator tots special that came with some kind of korean sauce on top in my opinion it didnt go well together and just plain tots would have been better then we tried two pizzas one was the potato head pizza and the other the brie and apple pizza the brie and apple pizza was so sweet that i didnt want more than a few bites the potato pizza we were all super excited about but was disappointed that the potatos were chips was excepting more of a soft potato also the sauce  tasted like ketchup and the dough less than mediocre

i ordered my appetizer sigara boregi at first i was concern since im not a fan of feta cheese it tasted sooo  good think of it as a turkish version of an empanada great hot appetizer for my dinner i ordered the lamb shanks 2795 i know the price is high but definitely worth it the meat was so tender and you could easily peal it out of the bone great portion

my only complaint was that my bf ordered chicken patties the patties were small wish they were bigger not the size of chicken nuggets his cabbage beet and carrots salad overtook the plate the taste was good but the patties were just too small i would still definitely come again",2020-01-24 01:09:53,780vGfc4EVAFHVqyy_Fz-g

some 25 years ago my mom lived in cocoa and any time my family came to visit shed want to stop at dixie crossroads all i could remember after 25 years was the memory of the tasty food well its for sure my taste buds didnt let me down we made a trip down here to see a concert in tampa i thought about other things i remembered and told my wife that a stop at dixie was on our schedule we arrived were seated and the waitress brought over their famous corn fritters which i had forgotten about well thats how this evening went starting with fried calamari salad and i had broiled scallops shrimp and 2 dozen rock shrimp my wife enjoyed what she described as one of the best prime ribs shes ever had along with that she had the rock shrimp to complete her surf  turf what a feast we both had we waddled out to the car and went back to our hotel 

now no meal would be complete without good service and we definitely had that my kudos go out to a young lady named anna she was right on top of everything keeping our glasses full and having a cheerful attitude

upon entering there was plenty of food stands to choose from i would suggest waiting because there are local food trucks near the end of the trail and their food is better 
the lights were really cool and creative it is not your average christmas light viewing there is a tall spiralcone when you first enter it is really trippy and fun to stare at 
even though there is a lot of walking i wish it was longer i also wish there was a better mapping system it is extremely crowded and the routes can get confusing

1.0,"35 stars but rounding up to 4 if you are careful to not order any of the kids menu items for your kiddos as well as any adult menu dishes that also appear on the kids menu but overall it was probably the best meals we had during our 8day trip to disney world

the adult entrees were very good we got the salmon and pork shank and the salmon was clearly sous vide so it was cooked perfectly and the shank was nicely slowbraised we felt like the appetizers were the weakest part of the meal the chicken terrine fell really flat but the stone fruit preserve went wonderfully with the popover later the shrimp cocktail was just ok because the shrimp was a bit overcooked but the sauce was good has a bit of a kick with the thai chili the tempura mushroom and bisque were delicious in flavor but the mushroom bisque was too salty i was happy to see more of the mushroom accompanying the salmon dish however i was interested in the popover that was supposed to come with the prime rib be cautious about ordering the prime rib howeverif its anything like the kids one its too tough so i ordered that on the side with my salmon instead of opting for the prime rib

the desserts were quite good and creative presentation was wonderful and it finished the meal nicely the cake was moist and the chocolate bits complemented it nicely the dark chocolate apple was scrumptious my favorite and the pie was well done especially if you like a bit of tartness in your sweets

we also all got different cocktail drinks one alcoholic one that was teabased and another with cotton candy and we liked them all pick one that appeals to you and it probably will be quite delicious

the food for the kids was probably a 1 star unfortunately which made me lower my rating to a 35 instead of 4 the chicken was way too dry the prime rib was tough i had to cut it into the thinnest pieces for my kid to be able to eat it they enjoyed their kid menu appetizers and sides though and we shared some of our dishes with them and they loved that more if youre not on the dining plan i would definitely recommend getting the salmon or pork for the kids and having them share it instead of ordering the kids meals

for those who are there for the characters we were not the queen was actually quite aboveandbeyond excellent with her character the other characters were also good but the queen really stood out and we were pleasantly surprised by that try to go to magic kingdom the day before and ride snow white and the seven dwarfs mine train if your kids are into coasters and it might help your kids get more into characters by the time you head over here for your dinner reservation the next day

prices are on par with other places in chinatown there are very few tables here because the space is so small and theres really no place to wait if you come here when its busy you might be sol but its worth trying again because youll be pleasantly surprised at the food at this little holeinthewall",2020-07-10 17:40:24,Fu7DYpJFm9h148x5fIEvTg

2nd let me say that i really do understand the challenges of running a restaurant during these difficult times its hard enough without the added requirements and change in business models esp for restaurants 
3rd ill take responsibility for not doing my part by checking the order before leaving  

unfortunately careless service is bad service and hence this 1star review 

we orderedpaid20 tip online for 1 combo  1 additional side dish about 55 total order we picked up our food which was ready and neatly boxed up bagged with the receipt attached super easy and friendly 

when we got home we discovered we only got the 1 side dish and nothing else  booo  

we called them we were direct but not rude 1 side dish wouldnt suffice for dinner  we asked them to deliver the rest of the order since we live 7 mins away they were nice and apologetic but said no they couldnt do that  booo 

we then asked for our money back well they couldnt do that either and said we needed to call back the next day booo 
why do i have to do the work to fix their mistake and since they have all my info just handle it 

so this is just a notice for others customers and their staff to please check your order before leaving the restaurant 

this one 55 order and lack of meaningful action to fix their mistake will likely cause us not to order from there again  unfortunate for all parties concerned",2020-06-28 19:12:55,4s_lBJeiT1QzLmecisH51A

1.0,"i absently drovewalked by the car museum sign for multiple years it was so great to finally check it out due to their limited hours saturdays only it took a bit of planning to make it happen

while awaiting my partner in crime i noted that there were other excited patrons in the parking lot  taking in and walking around cars that were parked outside

walking into the establishment the room opens up its seriously huge in there there were a few people greeting us at a ushaped glass casedesk entry fee is just 5 which is quite reasonable

it may be an understatement to say there are a lot of cars in this collection aside from the cars there is loads of other memorabilia including chili pit stop deodorant my personal fave matchbox cars clothing books oil cans parts of other vehicles and lots lots more

all of the vehicles are perfectly parked which i found amazing there was an information placard in front of each car as well many offered the history of the particular modelvehicle and others reflected what races they had been a part of and how they placed some of the folks perusing the collection work at the facility and have even drivenraced some of the vehicles definitely chat them up if you get the chance they have lots of great info and history to share and are very passionate about the collection

if youve seen the movie ford  ferrari youll be excited to learn that the fords that took 1st place and 3rd place in the race that was the highlight of the movie are actually here the car that took 3rd place even sported a price tag which i believe reflected  1012 million so save up

my understanding is that the cars in this facility are owned by a few private collectors so awesome that they opt to house them here so people can enjoy them and their histories as well",2020-01-07 03:49:03,UEz-qUwdhCm9KtgBdEdczA

1.0,"review the michelada was spicy light and refreshing one of the best ive had the house hash browns were crispy with a soft center buttery seasoned and delicious the bella bella benny was the highlight with a perfect runny egg paired with the nuttiness of the cheese saltines from the prosciutto and sweetness of the cream cheese hollandaise sauce all layered ontop of a crunchy toasted ciabatta base the chile verde benedict however lacked flavor and spice overall the pulled pork was decent the chile verde sauce had no kick the pico de gallo  added acidity and the cotija cheese elevated it minimally cant wait to go back and try other menu items

rating 810

bella bella benny thin slices of prosciutto taleggio cheese and poached cagefree eggs on toasted ciabatta topped with cream cheese hollandaise balsamic glaze and arugula 

chile verde benedict green chile sauced tortillas and melted cheese with your choice of slow cooked pulled pork or barbacoa style beef topped with poached cagefree eggs green chile hollandaise pico de gallo and cotija cheese",2020-02-21 18:51:41,MXq3yaKYUfkj7zEOYiP_2A

1.0,"we had a party of 2 at 515 pm on a saturday which is during their happy hour we were originally seated by the door but it was chilly so they were so kind to move us upstairs 

they have happy hour every day from 36 pm there isnt very much on their happy hour menu but the fact that they have it every single day even on the weekends is very nice

for drinks we got the forester sour and the spanish margarita 7 each during happy hour both were really good

for food we got patatas bravas 5 during happy hour 7 normally ceviche de jalapeño 1250 pimientos de padron 5 during happy hour 950 normally montaditos 11 even though on the menu its listed at 1250 potato tortilla 5 during happy hour 65 normally and chicken croquettes 9 everything was delicious our favorites were the montaditos and ceviche de jalapeño six tapas between two people was the perfect amount of food we finished everything and we were definitely full in fact we probably couldve gotten away with just ordering 5 plates

for dessert we got the churros con chocolate 6 for 8 it came with chocolate sauce and dulce de leche to dip them in the churros were not traditional churros we would not get them again

we used the yelp 30 for 40 deal which was great

the service was excellent our waitress ashley got everything right they spaced the dishes out for us so that we werent overwhelmed by the food she constantly checked on us multiple managers also came over to ask how we were doing we were so impressed

we will definitely be back i would suggest getting there before happy hour ends for good deals",2020-02-24 02:03:26,B-nz1ZBp9GdevG3pCuLo-A

-1.0,cool experience but the blue milk is disgusting and everything is overpriced  you need a reservationcheckin with the cast in order to get in and theres no guarantees seating  our party of 4 was crowded onto the edge of a bar where there was a lot of traffic  we ordered the banthasomething which was the blue milk with a cookie on top for 13  the blue milk is like coconut milk with pineapple juicebanana flavor and the texture of slimy dairy  its advertised as plant based so i shouldnt have been surprised but we immediately regretted ordering it after we tasted it  the cookie was decent though although not worth 13  someone else ordered an alcoholic drink that was very sweet and fizzy but so much better than the milk  getting ahold of our server was also a struggle they seemed very busy but all of the staff were very friendly  the interior was decorated intricately and the staff would participate in singing and dancing to keep the cantina feel going  bottom line another great place to explore but its not worth the price if you actually want to eatdrink,2020-03-02 02:59:14,1ntMlC5-2UMxAuCUiYUx-A

-1.0,"i am a fairly frequent visitor to cambridge and so far bagelsaurus is my favorite place for a bagel twice  we unsuccessfully tried buying bagels from bagelsaurus earlier this month the first time the person in front of me bought the last bagelit was about 130p on a weekend the second time it was earlier in day  but still on the weekend  when we saw at least 30 people lined up outside the door we decided to leave and come up with a plan b for bagels bagelsaurus should do what disneyland does with its linesyou have a 45 min wait from this point  they could also tell you the likelihood of being able to buy anything other than a plain bagel

so i searched best bagels in yelpof course and goldilox came up along with some other places  we chose goldilox because one of the reviewers said it had surpassed bagelsaurus as their new favorite  plus we thought it was a cute name

i had such high hopes but it wasnt even close  it looked like there were about 7 regular flavors of bagels i saw on the board one was rosemary which sounded yummy but it was sold out 

i ordered the sesame  it did have seeds on top and bottom  which i like  my problem was that they were sooo skimpy with the scallion cream cheese  if the line hadnt been so long i would have gone to counter and asked for more  a normal amount of schmear would have salvaged the visit

this next comment didnt have anything to do with the establishment and wasnt counted in my rating but there was a very irritating experience i want to share with the limited seating  i had my eye on a small open table so we could sit down while we ate   i didnt grab it because there were several people ahead of us in line and in fairness they should have first dibs at the table  then when we were next in line this guy about 5 positions behind us put his stuff on the table  on what planet is that okay  he was even by himself and was there to read  im sorry but when its that crowded eat and get out so someone else can sit down  just a selfish guy

i might give this place one more chance to try the rosemary bagel but id go earlier and during the week  and i would not give them a pass on skimping on the schmear",2020-03-23 20:38:17,uzmAi6kyLBRNOgMpTwGVrg

i literally just had the best pedicure i have ever had in my life i can only recall one other time that a pedicure was as good as this and i think that was my first one i ever got so thats really not an experience i can judge against since it was my first of course i thought it was awesome


i was in a hurry but had a little time to kill i normally get my pedicures in south austin since thats where i live but i was up north because my dog groomer is up here i happened to be right here and saw the sign for the salon and randomly went in i was so lucky that i found this place

i got the basic pedicure 40 helen was able to get me out on time to pick up my doodlebug from the groomer but in the short time that i was at the salon she fixed both of my big toes which were ingrown on both sides gave the best massage of anyone ive gone to in austin and gave me a lovely purple polish

-1.0,i love vegan vegetarian food even though i personally am not either of those but sadly this place was pretty disappointing i ordered the bbq ribs and the buddha bowl and as they look delicious in the pictures they are pretty underwhelming the ribs looked like they would be covered in a spicy bbq sauce but they came to me with no sauce and a bed of white rice tried them and have a really off taste i added some sauce that i had in my cupboard to try and salvage them the buddha bowls meat also has a weird taste and is too salty the sauce they give isnt strong enough to pair with the salty meat also got their steamed bun and that was my least favorite really bready and the veggies are crunchy and equally strange tasting im really bummed because all of the pictures look soo good but i honestly wish i had opted to go somewhere ive been before,2020-07-29 03:26:54,iMWzwWEBeTaucaw3LxjVyQ

1.0,"for someone who can eat gluten i cant say ill be making mochi donuts my go to for donuts however im glad i had the experience the mochi donut is soft chewy and has a nice ricecoconut kind of flavor in fact i liked the mochi donut so much that i wish there was an option for plain donuts with no icing on top 

that said some of the flavors were really great matcha guava and black sesame were my faves they complemented the donuts flavor and werent over the top some of the other flavors however were too sugary for me birthday cake the worst offender the ube flavor too was not heavy on the ube and mostly was just sweet 

id like to see some fruit topped donuts or something refreshing like that of course since they make large batches and deliver them later fruits might be difficult it is very impressive that the donuts arent technically fresh but taste so fresh and you cant argue against donuts delivered right to your doorstep especially during the pandemic",2020-08-11 03:03:58,9m1WybvjmsX2QhRnLK3CmQ

-1.0,"25 stars

cons
ordered online for pickup specifically noted in the online order that i needed no tomatos and lettuce wrap came with both 
menu on their website says addons are 1 the online ordering system charged 150 per i added fries to my wrap and it had three fries in it definitely not worth the up charge 
staff member behind the register wore his mask around his chin during covid there was a plastic barrier but masks are safer and i believe mandatory by order of the state 

pros
was happy to see the food was made to order even the chicken it wasnt sitting in a warmer all day 
spicy chicken had great flavor 
perfect portion 


id order again when covid is over and i can safely be there inperson to order and ensure my order is done right",2020-08-14 19:03:42,ObgbfPAlhi8wLinMiX55xg

i ordered a london fog latte and fell in love with its subtle and natural sweetness and perfect foam that stayed until i finished my drink the chocolate cake was served with whipping creme on the side and was extremely satisfying

i was there 15 minutes before closingunknowingly and told staff that we were going to dine in he politely informed us of their store hour but said we were welcome to stay 30 minutes after closing until it was his time to clean the dine in area he was extremely courteous and we felt very welcomed thank you",2020-08-01 19:19:16,Yqu-BlzvVPKdrOpb14Q3aQ

-1.0,"life alive is a cool spot in back bay thats great for lunch the ambience of the location is really nice and when its nice out they have a patio where you can sit outside the service is also great and the workers are super friendly 

read this as 35 stars there are 2 main reasons why i am giving it 35 stars 

1 the food can be very inconsistent i come here decently often and sometimes ill order the same thing a few times in a row but it can come out tasting different at different times or the portion sizes will be different sometimes my bowl will be very delicious and other times itll be small and fairly bland

2 i dont feel as if their sides and add ons are all appropriately priced i ordered the adventurer and got the roasted brussels sprouts on the side for 2 extra my bowl came and i came with 6 halves literally 3 brussels sprouts which means a single brussels sprout is almost 1 each it feels like the pricing could be a bit more fair here 

all in all i really do think this location is a solid lunch spot it just has some kinks to work out especially compared to its more consistent sister restaurants like the one in central",2020-01-13 18:36:59,TDTxywrz8Y6MrmEzK8hf9w

-1.0,great ambiance both inside and outside friendly host at the front and appropriate wait times for covid table turnover sadly we had a rough experience with our food our carne asada nachos came out with hardly any cheese and just a few large pieces of steak that were very hard to eat with the chips not at all what we expected or wanted for a 17 menu item we had to ask multiple times for missing food items drinks silverware and napkins then when we did finally get our food one of the people in our party bit into his chicken taco and found there to be a large bone in the taco essentially making the taco just an entire chicken legbone we were offered another taco in its place but had already been waiting quite some time for the food so we decided to pass on an additional taco their chips and salsaguac were very good and would order those again all in all would be hesitant to go again however the atmosphere is very cute and fun would go just to enjoy the view,2020-10-17 22:06:44,FmBQZovbBp3WtnxjuMbAGg

-1.0,"wow i really do not enjoy writing bad reviews but its tough to redeem my recent experience i went in last week after a long day at work hoping to relax and enjoy a bite and a drink but sincerely nothing about this was pleasant very few customers weekday and yet still could barely get any service while sitting at one of the high tips right next to the bar the bartender tracy seemed to be one of those sleep to the top types overly friendly to people who looked like they had money to spend from first glance or obvious regulars but couldnt acknowledge the blue collar folk that she didnt recognize  the menu sounded decent but after noticing another patron who had ordered when i sat down not get their food after twenty five minutes i was not going to take that risk for myself 

the redeeming star on this review is for the stiff pour damn well better be for 10 a shot of jameson but maybe that was just so she didnt have to pay attention to the lowly folk while she networked 

scrolling through other low reviews on yelp i havent noticed much activity by the owner apologizing or even acknowledging bad experiences bummer because i was hoping to come back on a friday night for live music but if its slow and i cant get service no way am i coming back on a busy night thanks but no thanks",2020-03-02 19:21:33,YvnFLLWgYMlvh10CtWu5SQ
1.0,this place had great reviews on yelp and since i was visiting austin and knew a lot of people there i asked them for their recommendation and they all told me this place would be terrific well when that many people tell you its terrific you can expect it is going to be and it was after a decent weight in line which i expected its the typical barbecue style ordering where you walk down the length of the counter and point at all of the delicious meats you would like to eat the business colleague and i as is usually the case ordered entirely too much food but then we were compelled to eat it all it was delicious definitely a place i would come back to,2020-10-27 14:00:28,EfdJfCzZrvUI9v-bI0gv2w
-1.0,have been going here with the missus for a while now when they first opened the food was very good now the quality has deteriorated and so has the staff the guy with the glasses the owners husband is rude af i wanna punch him whenever i see his face and the other skinny guy who was first the waiter now that theres another young skinny waiter considered himself promoted and hence acts like i do him a favor by going there the only nice person there is the older gentlemen who doesnt speak very much english or at least doesnt talk much is very kind and always smiles and appreciates people there the other two guys are asholes i stopped going there because of them and if the owner allows her useless dumb arrogant as of a husband to run the place pretty soon its going to go down i started going to punjab cafe in quincy instead and the food there is damn good id rather drive an extra 20 mins and be treated nicely than see their smug faces,2020-02-29 17:33:10,seX2ME_Bqo8qbbt39WdMvg

1.0,"burgers are one of my goto meals so im glad pdx was open and available for delivery and takeout on caviar

on their menu you can get any of their burgers in the slider size or full size for me 23 sliders was enough and gives you an option to try their menu of 12 flavors 

sliders will range 5 and full size burgers will range 95
___________________

 items we tried  

 portland  one of my faves i think the single patty had a good ratio in slider size and would prefer this over the double patty bun was toasted and meat was medium 

 tilikum  nice change from an original burger patty it was a little too salty for my preference but the slaw  sauce balances it out plenty of slaw to go around 

 steel  sooo savory i thought this was good but i felt the meatbun ration didnt hold up well it was super tasty so if i just got this slider i would probs be good with only 2 for my meal honestly if you enjoy bacon caramelized onions or both you should definitely try this option

 ross island  would pass on this next time loved how they had a veggie option and you can see all the corn and ingredients mixed in but i would have preferred the patty to be a little more firm 

 division philly  second fave of the order nice change from the usual and the ciabatta bun paired well with the american cheese and slices of meat

1.0,"yes it is a 100 charge but when you think about potential souvenirs from disney this is real top notch

pros 

the droids are of decent quality especially the r2 units these are pretty much a radio controlled car

amazing staff they will help you with anything you need i had a little trouble but they have plenty of staff to tend to needs

as a kid i would have been blown away the presentation of the site puts build a bear to shame 

there is a test area right outside the store pretty much a play pen for your kids to test their new friend

cons

the bb units are a little less sturdy hence why i went with the r2

your kids might get a little color crazy with the droids but hey its all good

the add on sale options with the droids get a little nuts thats really up to your own impulse buying discipline


bottom line

one of the best attractions at galaxys edge pay the 100 and go see it if you can handle it you could buy far worse souvenirs at a comparable cost",2020-02-05 18:19:19,yb7NgF6pF2p32-r_LTUN8A
-1.0,this store is under new ownership the previous owner was amazingdid everything for you at fair prices and quick service the new owners eh not so much i happened to go in to see about having some alterations done on a jacket i was lucky to go in when the seamstress was there and explained what i wanted i dropped off the jacket and got my slip saying when the item would be ready 2 days past the date it should be ready i call and am told the seamstress has been gone on vacation for a couple weeks and they are not sure when my jacket will be ready a few days later they say it is ready i pick it up and the work was fine and it was a good price but when my husband stopped by a week or so later to get a suit jacket altered he was told that they have no idea when and if the seamstress might be in so just take your item someplace else wow so we will never be taking anything there ever again since it is so unreliable now such a shame since it is close to home and other shops but we will go elsewhere for our dry cleaning and alterations,2020-11-05 23:49:47,cYkw7PB_PCUNmlXj4a_6Qw

-1.0,"just a headsup that these guys are not implementing any covid precautions beyond a hand scrawled sign that says something like per city order wear mask 

i called ahead specifically to ask if they were taking precautions and they said yes i asked if id have to come inside and they said no

no one who was working was wearing masks or bothered to distance themselves even when it was totally unnecessary to approach me leaned into my driver side window with no mask on pulled my car out with no mask on etc and i was required to go inside to pay

1.0,"my situation is unique but my experience is not i moved into eudom with a few years clean to use as a tool so that i could facilitate a relocation to which this facility has been key my experience has been absolutely fantastic in both the way my situation was handled and the way that i observed their handling of others unique situations

the apartments

during my stay i lived in two units my first unit was occupied when i arrived by another individual who kept the unit relatively clean though it did get much better when i arrived we did a deep clean and got it looking pristine my second unit was a pet friendly unit which was unoccupied upon my arrival this unit was already cleaned very well by the staff prior to me moving in

maintenance concerns were addressed immediately and my two issues were resolved in just one attempt my first unit had a quirk where a small amount of water entered through the sliding glass door and left a few splashes on the floor i only informed the staff so that nothing was damaged but they came and fixed it quick the other issue was light bulbs that werent working i submitted the note one night and the next day they replaced them  i mention this because it would appear that even small issues get resolved quickly

the staff

every person i have interacted with has been extremely helpful kind and considerate the rca team is generally very engaged and will spend time to chat with me about whatever it is that i may need the manager nick has always been extremely approachable whenever i felt the need to bug him in his office i really like bouncing ideas off him and do it quite a bit

the community

there are men here who and thriving and pushing themselves farther and farther these men have ambitions and goals and its rewarding to see them succeed 

from my conversations with others it does appear that there are men  who arent doing what is necessary to progress this came as a surprise to me but it does make sense as a few of them stay in their own apartments and dont typically interact with others

bottom line 

i have learned that it isnt the sober living the rehab the detox or the structure that keeps you clean  its the work you do on yourself outside of those areas that allow you to grow in recovery my primary in moving to austin was to be safe i am very safe at eudom to my surprise i have gotten more than i had hoped for i have made connections with others and i have been able to help others find success

overall this is a fantastic sober living environment the caveat as with any sober living it is only as good as you make it",2020-01-21 02:08:16,ssPiWaSBlu81gfqpnRIfsQ

1.0,"im pretty impressed upon my first visit upon arrival and checking in the wait time was appropriate considering it was a weekend night i did make the mistake of going back to the old routine of getting a drink at the bar while i waited for a table but staff were nice about it when they didnt have to be there was plenty of respectable distance between tables and seats and staff and patrons wore mask except to eat of course there were so many things on the drink and food menu that i wanted to try its leads to motivation to hurry back i ordered the chicken and waffles  oh wow it was delicious  a good balance of sweet and spice the drink i had was the king james and oh wow again with another delicious it was a good size cocktail for 8 
staff were friendly fun and professional
the place was clean and was prepared quickly for the next guest
parking around creekside  the is a free parking garage
they do have a kids section on the menu
they open for brunch on saturday and sunday with a pleasing brunch drink menu

-1.0,"how disappointing was this place i got a gel mani and regular pedi for my honeymoon  it was bad all around 

the woman doing my mani cut and filed my nails at a slant i had to ask her to redo them 23x and they still ended up uneven they dont soak your nails so prepare for your cuticles to look jagged 2 days in the nail polish was applied so thick and unevenly she had to file my cuticles to smooth down her application which hurt and left my cuticles sore my nails still look patchy and chunky im on day 3  all of my nails have chipped and the paint is lifting off the sides quite unusual for gel 
 
the woman that did my pedi was so distracted checking her phone walking around for no reason during the service and clipped my skin 3x causing me to bleed the woman that painted my toes was nice but i noticed that the nail polish shrunk on my toes too much thinner added to expand the longevity of the nail polish bottle they kept asking to redo it even though i had another salon appt right after they convinced me to let them do another coat with another bottle of polish and i had to walk to my other appt in the 30 degree weather in the thinnest pedi flipflops one block in the polish smudged looking wrinkly and uneven

1.0,"i made a great decision to lease my 2020 kia sportage this past november from southwest kia i had been driving a toyota rav4 for 12 years and sold it last march i had purchased a 2018 kia forte to replace it but found that im just not a car person and wanted to get back into an suv so my husband now has the forte and we traded his car in for my sportage it was a great decision and im super pleased with it this is by far the nicest vehicle ive ever owned and ive been pleasantly surprised with all that kia has to offer and at such a reasonable price

the staff at southwest kia from the receptionist to the sales person to the finance manager to the service department are friendly informative  and professional i didnt feel like i was being pressured into making a decision either 

overall i am very pleased with my decision to purchase my vehicle from southwest kia i highly recommend them",2020-01-07 00:15:29,Oiz0FojH4fjUTzw8Nrms4Q
1.0,"good cafe for brunchlunch catching up with friends or studying 

quite a few tables and very spacious a friend and i came around 1pm and ordered the matcha souffle pancakes a chicken sandwich and an iced dark mocha

pancakes took around 25 min to make they were soft airy and jiggly however there was not much matcha taste to it

chicken sandwich on whole wheat bread was really good good proportions of chicken to veggies and bread not too dry and had enough sauce  

iced dark mocha was so good not too sweet and the bitterness of the coffee complimented well with the dark chocolate id just come here for a coffee run 

definitely should give this place a try",2020-02-21 07:36:50,oNqK5Qop5pOhIe9nvffbVw

1.0,"the rosen centre hotel is conveniently located across from the orange county convention center and about 5 miles from universal orlando   we were visiting from friday through sunday bid 89night for a 4 star property on priceline and were awarded this property

when we arrived we were told there was no place to park in front of the hotel while we checked in and unloaded our bags and we were sent around the back to park in the garage  its a bit odd when driving to the garage and not terribly welcoming as one must drive around the side of the hotel pass trash dumpsters and loading and service areas make a number of turns and finally come to the garage entrance  once parked and we made our way inside there was a long walk through the conference areas past the restaurants bar and entrance to the pool but once we finally got to the front desk checkin was fast and easy

this hotel contains a very large conference center a few larger bars and restaurants a tiny mexican eatery and similar sized sushi place which were really just counter seating with a guy behind it taking orders making food and serving  the only onproperty restaurant we took advantage of was harrys poolside where we had a few appetizers on friday after we arrived here and we also ordered from there while we lounged by the pool and took advantage of both the swimming pool and the hot tubs on saturday   everything we had from harrys poolside was good and unlike our experience with universal resort the drinks from this poolside bar were well made 

the room where we stayed was nicely appointed and looked as if it was recently updated one oddity was that the sink was located outside the actual bathroom and was more or less open to the room perhaps thats convenient for some hotel guests but it seemed a bit odd to have to exit the bathroom in order to shave or brush ones teeth and to do it in view of others staying there  the channel selection on the tv was good and there was an inroom coffee maker  wifi was free and fast  the bed was comfortable and i slept well on both nights of our stay the cvs thats adjacent to this hotel was also a bonus

note that they normally charge i believe 15night for guests to park overnight in the adjacent garage  maybe we were lucky or it was just because we tended to get back later at night after wed visited the park and the gate for the garage was open but we were fortunate enough to park free of charge all weekend",2020-02-20 15:48:03,-VOylYXNq7sG6As966yTxA

if you are wondering why this only has 3 stars it is for the atrocious service by our waiter he was very absent  we waited a while to order then the food and drinks came quickly but it was like pulling teeth trying to get him to bring us our bill  we actually had to ask the hostess to find him because we were ready to go  when he finally arrived and asked if we wanted the check why he didnt just bring it is beyond me then we waited another 10 minutes with the card out waiting on the bill  i would be much more understanding if it was dead in there but there was maybe 2 other tables in there being used at the time

we arrived around 600pm and there was already people waiting outside on the waiting list we waited about 35 minutes before getting seated the wait was very well worth it i would do another vancouver trip just for this ramen

this a chickenbased broth creamy dreamy luscious type of ramen the ramen menu is straight to the point because the only broth they serve is the chickenbase broth but the tiers of ramen are because of the toppings so anything you choose will be a great choice just depends on the toppings you like

the prices were cheap coming from san francisco that has ramen that can run up to 18 the ramen were was only 13 their noodles are handmade in the store on each table some tables are also communal so just be aware of that  has sesame seeds garlic chips and chili flakes  so amazing on top of their already amazing ramen

i havent had ramen since marutama because i just know it wont be the same and i dont want to be sad that it isnt marutama

it was still a couple hour wait to get all of the paperwork taken care of and the car ready to go but they didnt try to push any extras on me when i showed up and they were respectful  if i bought a car in the future id like to do it the same way",2020-02-11 22:25:43,kYZGsrCrhboHRHkMbuhf8g

last week was my first visit to dr chopra  because we had to maintain social distancing we only spoke on the phone  the doctor provided a thorough analysis of my cats problem clearly explained the possible causestreatment options and successfully treated my cats problem  the young man at the front desk and nurse that admitted my cat were both excellent sorry that i am horrible remembering names  both employees were polite friendly and professional  i also had the opportunity to observe the young man helping other waiting customers and he was equally great with them explaining their medicationtreatment options",2020-05-29 13:38:24,1VCKSD8Cwg87-yqR48Ouzw

1.0,"so good im always impressed when i can find a thick cut pizza in town we tried out the veggie  pepperoni both gluten free versions i love that they offer this ive had a few unimpressive gluten free doughs before but this one was incredible to be honest we only went with the gluten free bc they were sold out of the other versions but i was super impressed 

each pizza is cut into four square slices it lasted us two meals each be sure to account for extra time to eat that thick crust is delicious 

bread is everything in my pizza selection the burnt cheesy crust great toppings only other thing was there wasnt too much sauce on the veggie but otherwise a perfect first experience 

i cant wait to try them again soon",2020-12-27 18:00:09,SL4FGCbS3lbA9_iT-ME_1g

1.0,"when you think of fuzzys tacos dont think of an actually fuzzy taco my mind can wander there but think of it as a decent taco shop with lots of options that should please anyone  they have appetizers burritos salads bowls quesadillas platters including fajita and of course tacos

they have plenty of protein options such as chicken brisket ground beef shrimp grilled or fried fish grilled or fried  pork  i think i saw one veggie option so its kind of limited if youre doing plantbased

what they lack is variety of what goes on a taco  its basically lettuce tomato cheese feta and shredded and garlic sauce  its all the same regardless of the protein  sure they have some specialty tacos but some variety like a slaw for the fish tacos would be nice

prices are decent but it may take a few bucks to fill up a big eater at least with tacos  they used to have events and stuff here trivia etc but i havent seen anything here lately nor have i looked

with a lack of mexican spots in east orlando this is worthy of a stop if you crave tacos but i wouldnt drive from anywhere far away just to eat here",2020-12-04 21:21:39,t-MbBRkNIR0eM_Ha2dAF0w

if you are into old fashion dim sum cart golden ocean is the place to be in the west side huge assortments on the menu so if you dont see it in the cart they will bring it with a smile some items are only available on weekends and i do wish that was marked in the menu as i dont always remember

i also wish the have chrysanthemum tea as sometimes we prefer non caffeinated tea

dinner is yummy too if you prefer less flavour in your dishes you can ask for less salt and msg free each dishes are jam packed with flavour and plain rice is recommended to offset and balance the taste",2020-07-06 02:20:58,x6exB5R70coQB0T-HvqtUg

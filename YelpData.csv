ak0TdVmGKo4pwqdJSTLwWw,1,"Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. 

After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur√©e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. 

Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October."
YoVfDbnISlW0f7abNQACIg,1,"This store is pretty good. Not as great as Walmart (or my preferred, Milford Target), but closer and in a easier area to get to.  
The store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! 
Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). 
Christian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd / Route 30. 4 stars."
eC5evKn1TWDyHCyQAwguUw,1,"I called WVM on the recommendation of a couple of friends who had used them in the past and thought they did a nice job. I'm a fan now, too.

Evan and Cody showed up right on time for my move this past weekend. They were friendly and energetic, working quickly but carefully to get all my things moved out of the old place and into the new one in less than 2.5 hours. All of my (heavy) furniture arrived in perfect condition, and they took extra care not to scratch the wood floors in the process.

I hope not to move again anytime soon, but next time I do, I'll be calling WVM."
SFQ1jcnGguO0LYWnbbftAA,-1,"I've stayed at many Marriott and Renaissance Marriott's and this was a huge disappointment! The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.

The rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.

We got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance."
0kA0PAJ8QFMeveQWHFqz2A,1,"The food is always great here. The service from both the manager as well as the staff is super. Only draw back of this restaurant is it's super loud. If you can, snag a patio table!"
RNm_RWkcd02Li2mKPRe7Eg,-1,"This place used to be a cool, chill place. Now its a bunch of neanderthal bouncers hopped up on steroids acting like the can do whatever they want. There are so many better places in davis square where they are glad you are visiting their business. Sad that the burren is now the worst place in davis."
Q8c91v7luItVB0cMFF_mRA,-1,"The setting is perfectly adequate, and the food comes close.   The dining chains like Chilis and Victoria Station do barbecue better.

It's no surprise you can always pick up coupons for Linwood at restaurant.com."
XGkAG92TQ3MQUKGX9sLUhw,1,"Probably one of the better breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. I had the EGGMEATMUFFIN, the bread was toasted perfectly and the bacon was a real thick cut. Not that lame bacon we are more familiar with at your conventional breakfast diner. In addition, the place was clean and the staff was very helpful. The butcher had several different cuts available and was knowledgable as well as friendly. I left with some cuts of pork and beef and am excited to come back!"
LWUnzwK0ILquLLZcHHE1Mw,1,"I am definitely a fan of Sports Authority.  This particular location has a good check in deal.  We came here near Christmas time to buy some presents and we had a good experience.  The staff members were very friendly and they helped us find what we were looking for.  We got some golf stuff, two pairs of shoes, a tennis racket bag, and some bicycle accessories.  The store was clean and well organized.  They have everything from apparel to basketballs and everything in between.  Good spot to buy athletic merchandise."
99RsBrARhhx60UnAC4yDoA,1,"I work in the Pru and this is the most affordable and tasty place in the food court.  deals where a meal is $5-$7 and the chicken pesto is really good.   I am not a chowda person but all there soups I have had are pretty damn good.  Broccoli chicken is my favorite.  Also, probably the most personable Food court staff I have ever had the pleasure of ordering from."
